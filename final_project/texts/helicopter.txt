Preface
The modern helicopter is a sophisticated device that merges a surprising number of
technologies together. This wide range of disciplines is one of the fascinations of the helicopter, but it also makes a complete understanding difﬁcult. The very ability to hover,
which sets the helicopter apart, also dooms it forever to vibration, poor performance
and economy in forward ﬂight, and thus restricts its numbers.
The unique capabilities, complexity and inherent limitations are part of a helicopter’s
charm, and have given rise to some wonderful deﬁnitions and descriptions, which
generally contain more than a grain of truth:
A helicopter is a mechanical engineer’s dream and an aerodynamicist’s nightmare.
A helicopter is a collection of ball-races ﬂying in close formation.
A helicopter is a collection of vibrations held together by differential equations.
My own search for an understanding of the helicopter was hampered by the huge gap
between books containing beautiful photographs but little information and advanced
textbooks full of equations.
This, then, is the book that I couldn’t buy when I wanted to learn all this; it could
not be a conventional book because I have had such difﬁculty with them. It combines
theory and practice of how helicopters are made, how they ﬂy, how they are powered
and how they are controlled. It would be impossible to consider all of that without at
least some reference to ﬂying techniques.
Most technical books assume an existing level of knowledge, but the wide readership
and wide range of disciplines make that inappropriate here. Instead of making incorrect
assumptions about the reader, this book approaches every subject from ﬁrst principles,
and builds up in a clearly explained logical sequence using plain English and clear
diagrams, avoiding unnecessary mathematics.
Technical terms and buzzwords are all deﬁned, and acronyms are spelled out.
Misnomers, myths and old wives’ tales (for these are plentiful) are disposed of wherever
they arise. Whilst the contents of this book are expressed in straightforward language
there is no oversimpliﬁcation and all of the content is based on established physics and
accepted theory. The student of technology or aerodynamics will ﬁnd here a concise
introduction, leading naturally to the more advanced textbooks on the subject.
The would-be pilot will ﬁnd clear explanations of the principles to act as a perfect complement to the instruction itself. The experienced pilot will ﬁnd the detailed
descriptions of the characteristics of helicopters an aid to safety. This book covers
the theory of the helicopter in more than sufﬁcient depth to enable the reader to pass
the helicopter theory examination. There is enough practical information to allow the

“helic - FM” — 2003/11/22 — page xi — #11

xii Preface
reader to make sense of the machine’s ﬂight manual and to prepare for the helicopter
type examination.
The rotary wing ﬂying machine is just part of the larger subject of general aviation.
Related subjects such as human factors, meteorology, air law and navigation scarcely
differ with the type of ﬂying machine, and are not repeated here save for differences
speciﬁc to helicopters.

Introduction to rotorcraft
1.1

Applications of the helicopter

Although helicopters must all follow the same laws of physics, the forms that practical
machines take vary tremendously due to the range of tasks to which they can be put.
To avoid confusion, this book takes the view that an aircraft is any man-made aerial
machine capable of climbing out of ground effect. Thus a helicopter must be an aircraft.
Neglecting aerostats (balloons etc.) any aircraft that is not a helicopter will be an
aeroplane (USA: airplane).
It will be seen later in this book that the slower an aircraft goes, the more power it
needs to maintain height. Hovering is the ultimate case of slow ﬂight, suggesting that
helicopters must have a high power to weight ratio. This will require heavy engines and
a corresponding fuel capacity. These factors limit load carrying capability and range.
The mechanical complexity of the helicopter and the inevitable vibration demand a
lot of maintenance. The airspeed of the true helicopter is forever restricted by fundamental limits. It will generally be more expensive to move a given load by helicopter
than by almost any other means, and so if a suitable airstrip exists, a ﬁxed-wing aircraft can do the job at lower cost, and generally at a higher airspeed. In most cases
helicopters cannot compete economically with aeroplanes, and so their use is restricted
to applications for which aeroplanes, or other forms of transport, are unsuitable.
In remote areas, there will be no airstrips; in wartime, runways are conspicuous
targets, and, with the exception of the aircraft carrier, are ﬁxed. The helicopter’s ability
to hover means that it can land almost anywhere a fairly ﬂat ﬁrm surface exists. Some
are genuinely amphibious, landing with equal aplomb on water or land. If the ground
is unsuitable (or if the waves are too high) many helicopters can transfer goods and
passengers whilst in the hover.
This ability makes the helicopter the ideal rescue vehicle. Many lives have been saved
because the helicopter can get to places that would otherwise be difﬁcult or impossible
to reach. War casualties, the victims of shipwrecks, mountain climbing accidents and
natural disasters such as earthquake or ﬂood today have signiﬁcantly higher chances
of survival because a helicopter can get them rapid treatment.
The accounts of helicopter rescues make more thrilling reading than novels because
they are true. Helicopters have ﬂown far out of range of the shore by taking fuel from
oilrigs and ships, sometimes taking fuel in the hover if a landing was impossible. This
would be remarkable in good weather, but emergencies occur in all weather conditions
and the helicopter has evolved to handle the worst.
Despite their life-saving ability, most of today’s helicopters were originally designed
for military use. As military ﬁxed-wing aircraft became faster and faster, they found

“helic - CHAP01” — 2003/11/22 — page 1 — #1

2 The Art of the Helicopter
it harder to attack ground targets or to support ground troops. During the Vietnam
War, it was found that the helicopter had a major role. Transport helicopters excelled
inserting and withdrawing troops, delivering ammunition and food, evacuating the
wounded, recovering the crews of downed planes and even the planes themselves.
Armed helicopters proved to be ideal for attacking ground targets. At ﬁrst these were
general-purpose machines hurriedly ﬁtted with weapons, but later dedicated attack
helicopters evolved, complete with armour plating and redundant systems to allow
them to withstand ground ﬁre. As their load carrying capability has increased, these
machines have virtually rendered the tank obsolete.
Although ideal against ground targets, the helicopter is slow and vulnerable to attack
from the air. Fixed-wing planes are necessary to provide the air superiority in which the
helicopters operate. As an alternative, helicopters can operate under stealth conditions,
avoiding detection by using terrain.
Large military helicopters are very expensive to operate, and armed forces found it
worthwhile to have simpler machines speciﬁcally for training purposes. A small number
of helicopters have been designed speciﬁcally for the civil market and these are popular
with large companies for executive transport.
For the average private owner, the sheer cost of running helicopters precludes all
but the smallest machines with aeroplane-derived piston engines. Virtually all other
helicopters are now turbine powered.

1.2

A short technical helicopter history

This is not a history book and this section must necessarily be brief. The reader interested in the US history of the helicopter is recommended to the comprehensive yet
highly readable works of Jay Spenser.1,2 The recent book by Steve Coates, Helicopters
of the Third Reich,3 is essential reading to the historian as it shows how far ahead of the
rest of the world German helicopter engineers were at that time. For those who read
French, two more fascinating volumes are available. L’Histoire de l’Hélicoptère by Jean
Boulet4 contains the words of helicopter pioneers themselves. Les Hélicoptères Florine
1920–1950 by Alphonse DuMoulin5 recounts the pioneering work of Nicolas Florine.
The history of the helicopter has been very short indeed. In comparison with ﬁxedwing aircraft, helicopters need more power, have to withstand higher stresses, are harder
to understand and control and have more moving parts. It is hardly surprising that the
development of the helicopter took place well after that of the ﬁxed-wing aircraft.
Early helicopters lacked enough power to ﬂy. Once helicopters were powerful enough
to leave the ground, they were found to be uncontrollable. Once the principles of control
were understood, they were found to vibrate and to need a lot of maintenance and so
on. Today’s helicopters represent the sum of a tremendous number of achievements in
overcoming one obstacle after another.
Before World War II helicopters were in an experimental phase. This was the heyday
of the gyroplane, invented by the Spaniard Juan de la Cierva and technically reﬁned
by Raoul Hafner, an Austrian working in England who would later contribute much
to the development of the helicopter.6
The ﬁrst practical helicopter was the Focke-Wulf Fw-61 of 1938 (Figure 1.1), followed
in the same year by the Weir W-5 (Figure 1.2) that ﬂew two years before Sikorsky’s
VS-300 (Figure 1.3). The urgencies of war accelerated all technical development with
the emergence of production helicopters, where the work of Anton Flettner (Figure 1.4)
and Heinrich Focke was far in advance of anything taking place elsewhere.

Introduction to rotorcraft 3

Fig. 1.1 The Focke-Wulf Fw-61 was the ﬁrst helicopter to move beyond the experimental stage and was
capable of extended ﬂights. The hull was based on that of an Fw Stieglitz aeroplane. Note the vestigial
airscrew that simply cools the engine. (Steve Coates)

Fig. 1.2 The Weir W-5 ﬂew extensively, but development of all helicopters was suspended in the UK during
World War II. (AugustaWestland)

The Focke-Achgelis Fa-223 shown in Figure 1.5 became, on 6 September 1945, the
ﬁrst helicopter to cross the English Channel when a captured machine was ﬂown to
England by Hans Gerstenhauer. This machine had a payload of 2000 kg.7
Helicopter development in the UK was halted by government order during World
War II and, being an Austrian, Hafner was locked up, but fortunately not for long.

4 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 1.3 The Sikorsky VS-300 had an extended development period during most of which cyclic control was
not understood and unwieldy auxiliary rotors were used instead. (Igor I. Sikorsky Historical Archives Inc.)

Fig. 1.4 The Flettner Kolibri (Hummingbird) was the ﬁrst synchropter and was an advanced and capable
machine. Kaman developed the concept and produced the successful Husky and K-Max models. (Steve Coates)

“helic - CHAP01” — 2003/11/22 — page 4 — #4

Introduction to rotorcraft 5

Fig. 1.5 The Focke-Achgelis Fa-223 was a large and capable machine that was in production during World
War II. Few were produced due to Allied bombing. The machine was far ahead of anything else in the world at
the time. (Steve Coates)

In Germany, production was hampered by Allied bombing, whereas US helicopters
were unreﬁned. The result was the same: helicopters made little contribution to the
war itself.
After World War II great progress was made in the understanding of helicopter
dynamics and stability. This led directly to machines that were less stressful to ﬂy and
correspondingly safer. The Bell 47 (Figure 1.6) based on the research of Arthur Young
was in 1946 the ﬁrst helicopter to be certiﬁed. The Sycamore of 1952 (Figure 1.7)
designed by Hafner, was the ﬁrst British helicopter to be certiﬁed and was noted not
just for its performance, but also for its light control forces which needed no power
assistance.8
Advances in constructional techniques and materials continued to improve the
service life of components, especially blades. Possibly the most signiﬁcant single step

“helic - CHAP01” — 2003/11/22 — page 5 — #5

6 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 1.6 The legendary Bell 47 was based on Arthur Young’s research and was the ﬁrst helicopter to be certiﬁed
in the USA. Larry Bell never liked the utilitarian appearance, but it outsold all of the more stylish models. The
ﬂybar stabilization system was adopted extensively in later Bell machines. (Bell Helicopter Textron)

Fig. 1.7 The attractive Sycamore was Hafner’s masterpiece and the ﬁrst helicopter to be certiﬁed in the UK.

Introduction to rotorcraft 7

Fig. 1.8 The Bell Huey was ofﬁcially designated the Iroquois, but the Helicopter, Utility designation, HU-1,
led to the nickname of Huey, which stuck. In Vietnam the Huey was used in enormous numbers. (Bell Helicopter
Textron)

was the introduction of the turbine engine which was much lighter than the piston
engine for the same power, yet had fewer moving parts. This allowed greater payload
and a reduction in maintenance.
The ﬁrst turbine-powered helicopter to ﬂy was a modiﬁed Kaman K-225 in 1951 and
in 1954 the ﬁrst twin-turbine machine, also a Kaman, ﬂew. The Bell Huey ﬁrst ﬂew
in 1956 (Figure 1.8). It was in the 1960s that the many disciplines in helicopter design
were ﬁnally mastered allowing the machine to be considered as a system. Some elegant
and deﬁnitive designs emerged during this period. Such was the validity of their basic
concepts that they could accept a steady succession of upgrades that would allow them
in some cases to remain in service to the present day. Sikorsky’s S-61 and Boeing’s
Chinook are good examples of longevity.
Since that time there have been few breakthroughs; instead there has been a steady
process of reﬁnement. The introduction of composite materials in blades, rotor heads
and body parts has reduced weight and extended service life. Reﬁnements in mechanical engineering have produced lighter engines and transmissions having longer life.
Manufacturers have used production engineering to reduce the amount of labour
needed to build machines.
Instead of a revolution, the employment of electronics and computers in helicopters
has seen steady and relentless progress. There is no wear mechanism in electronics
and complicated transfer functions can be realized in lightweight parts that use little
power. Items such as turbine engine controllers and rotor rpm governors are ideal
applications for electronics, along with stability augmentation systems. The ﬂexible
control systems that electronics make possible have enabled developments such as the
tilt-rotor helicopter.
Helicopters can survive engine failures and the failure of a variety of parts, but
there remain some parts such as gearboxes and rotor heads in which failure will be
catastrophic. The technique of electronically monitoring critical components has made
a great contribution to safety. Spontaneous failures are very rare. Generally there are
symptoms such as a change in the characteristic of vibration or noise. These may be too
slight to be heard by the crew, but a sensor mounted on the affected part in conjunction

with a signal processor which knows what the normal sounds, or signature, from the
part are, can give vital warning of a potential problem.
The life of a component may be reduced if it is subjected to higher stress. Modern
electronic systems (HUMS: Health and Usage Monitoring Systems) can measure stress
and the time for which it has been applied in order to calculate the safe remaining life
in major components.
Much fundamental research into helicopters was done using models. De la Cierva’s
early work was with free ﬂying model gyroplanes. Arthur Young used models extensively (Figure 1.9) and it was his demonstration of a model controlled by a trailing
wire that convinced Larry Bell to enter the helicopter business. Irven Culver at Lockheed built what was probably the world’s ﬁrst radio-controlled model helicopter in the
late 1950s.
Advances in radio control equipment in the 1960s made the necessary precision
available at reasonable cost and this led to the availability of ﬂying model helicopters

Fig. 1.9 Arthur Young ﬂies a wire-controlled model helicopter. Young was a philosopher who argued that
designing a helicopter would teach him how to think. He was right. (Bell Helicopter Textron)

for the model building enthusiast. As will be seen in Chapter 9, such models have
become highly sophisticated even though, like their full-sized counterparts, they remain
expensive to build and operate.
Conceptually somewhere between the model and the full-size helicopter is the UAV
(unmanned autonomous vehicle). These machines are designed to perform surveillance
tasks, typically carrying cameras and other sensors. As electronic and sensing devices
have become smaller, useful equipment can be carried aloft at much lower cost if there
is no need to carry a pilot. Unlike the model, which needs actively to be controlled by
the pilot on the ground at all times, the UAV carries enough navigational equipment,
automatic stabilization systems and processing power to be self-contained. Also unlike
the hobbyist’s machines, UAVs must be built and operated to professional standards.

1.3

Types of rotorcraft

The deﬁnition of a rotorcraft is quite general, embracing any ﬂying machine that
produces lift from rotors turning in a plane that is normally close to the horizontal.
This deﬁnition does not concern itself with the proportion of the machine’s weight
carried by the rotors, or whether that proportion changes at different stages of ﬂight.
Figure 1.10 shows the main classes of rotorcraft that will be deﬁned here.

10 The Art of the Helicopter
The pure helicopter obtains the great majority of its lift in all modes of ﬂight from a
power driven rotor or rotors, and any lift due to airﬂow around the hull is incidental.
The majority of today’s rotary wing machines are pure helicopters. The thrust from a
rotor is closely aligned with a line drawn perpendicular to the tip path, and the pure
helicopter propels itself by tilting the rotor forward to obtain a component of rotor
thrust which balances the drag, as shown in Figure 1.10(a).
The gyroplane (also known by de la Cierva’s trade name of autogyro) obtains lift
from an undriven rotor that must be tilted away from the direction of ﬂight to make
air ﬂow up through it. The rearward rotor-thrust component, along with the drag, is
balanced by the forward thrust of a conventional airscrew as shown in Figure 1.10(b).
As the rotor needs to be pulled through the air to maintain height, the autogyro cannot
hover in still air, although it can give the illusion of hovering by ﬂying into wind.
Simple autogyros must taxi to spin up the rotor, but later machines could spin the
rotors with engine power on the ground, and use the stored energy to perform a jump
take-off.
Between the pure helicopter and the gyroplane is the gyrodyne, which obtains lift
from a power driven rotor. Unlike the pure helicopter, the gyrodyne maintains the
rotor disc parallel to the direction of ﬂight, as in Figure 1.10(c) and propels itself with a
conventional airscrew. The Fairey Gyrodyne (Figure 1.11) replaced the tail rotor with
a side-mounted airscrew to cancel torque reaction when hovering, but also to provide
thrust for forward ﬂight. More recently the Lockheed Cheyenne (Figure 1.12) had both
anti-torque and pusher rotors at the tail. The gyrodyne offers high speed potential, with
the penalties of raised complexity, weight and difﬁculty of control. Some gyrodynes
have wings in addition to the rotor.

Fig. 1.11 The Fairey Gyrodyne had a side-mounted anti-torque rotor that became a tractor propeller in
forward ﬂight. (AugustaWestland)

“helic - CHAP01” — 2003/11/22 — page 10 — #10

Introduction to rotorcraft 11

Fig. 1.12 The Lockheed Cheyenne with ﬁxed-wing, anti-torque rotor and pusher propeller was a very fast,
highly manoeuvrable machine. (Lockheed Martin)

The compound helicopter is one that hovers like a helicopter, but which may obtain
supplementary lift from ﬁxed wings during ﬂight and may incorporate additional means
of providing forward thrust.
The convertiplane is a more extreme example of the compound helicopter in that
it reconﬁgures its means of providing lift and propulsion in different ﬂight regimes.
The Fairey (later Westland) Rotodyne was a convertiplane. Figure 1.13 shows that
it consisted of a twin turboprop aircraft-like structure with a pylon-mounted rotor
driven by tip jets. As a helicopter, the tip jet drive provided lift, and yaw control was
obtained by differentially changing the pitch of the turboprops. Forward thrust from
the airscrews would bring the machine to cruising speed, where much of the lift was
developed by the wing, and the tip jets were turned off such that the rotor free-wheeled
and the machine became a compound gyroplane.
Reconﬁguring can also be done by tilting the whole wing–engine–rotor assembly (tilt
wing) as shown in Figure 1.14(a) or by tilting the engine–rotor units on ﬁxed wings
(tilt rotor) as in Figure 1.14(b). The Bell-Boeing Osprey is a tilt rotor. As can be seen
in Figure 1.14(c), the diameter of convertiplane rotors is usually such that the machine
cannot land in the forward ﬂight conﬁguration, but must return to the hover.
The advantages of the convertiplane over the pure helicopter are that using the rotors
as airscrews reduces vibration, it is much more efﬁcient and allows a higher airspeed.
This reduces fuel consumed and allows greater range. The tilt rotor has its wing in
the downwash which reduces hover performance, whereas in the tilt wing the wing is
almost always working. However, the tilt wing needs a supplementary mechanism to
control the pitch axis, such as a jet or rotor at the tail.

1.4

Rotor conﬁgurations

The various conﬁgurations of the pure helicopter will now be considered. The most
common conﬁguration is the single main rotor and the anti-torque tail rotor. The
remaining conﬁgurations, shown in Figure 1.15, handle torque reaction by contrarotation. Contra-rotating helicopters have no need for the tail rotor, but generally have
a tail ﬁn or ﬁns for directional stability at speed.

Fig. 1.15 Types of contra-rotating helicopter. (a) The tandem. (b) The side-by-side. (c) The synchropter.
(d) The coaxial. See text for details.

In the tandem rotor helicopter, Figure 1.15(a), two rotors turn in opposite directions
at the opposite ends of a long hull. The rotors are usually synchronized through a
transmission system so that the shafts can be little more than a blade length apart. The
Chinook in Figure 1.16 is a good example of the type, the large disc area offering good
lifting ability, and the long cabin ample load space.
An alternative to the tandem rotor is the side-by-side twin rotor (Figure 1.15(b)).
This has aerodynamic advantages in forward ﬂight because the lifting area has a better
aspect ratio, but it is difﬁcult to avoid drag due to the structure needed to locate the
rotors each side of the hull and to carry the transmission across the machine. See
Figure 1.5. In large machines it is also difﬁcult to make the structure stiff enough to
avoid resonance and so the type is rare.
A relative of the side-by-side helicopter which has had more success is the synchropter
(Figure 1.15(c)) in which the two rotors mesh so closely that the contra-rotating shafts
can be driven by the same gearbox. The close meshing is achieved by tilting the shafts
outwards so that the blades of one rotor can pass over the rotor head of the other. The
German Kolibri of World War II, designed by Anton Flettner (Figure 1.4), was the
ﬁrst successful machine to use the idea. In the USA, Charles Kaman adopted the synchropter principle, and produced the famous H-43 Huskie which became the deﬁnitive
crash rescue helicopter of its time (Figure 1.17). The synchropter is the easiest of all

helicopters to ﬂy, as the interactions and second-order effects of the conventional
conﬁguration are eliminated, but replaced by some interesting yaw characteristics.
The ﬁnal approach to contra-rotation is the coaxial helicopter. Stanley Hiller and
Arthur Young both built such machines experimentally, but Nikolai Kamov in the
USSR put the idea into production (Figure 1.18). The coaxial helicopter places both
rotors one above the other on a common shaft, and drives them in opposite directions.
Like the synchropter, control interactions are reduced, but yaw control remains an issue.
The main advantage of synchropters and coaxial helicopters is that in the absence of a
tail rotor, the machine can be much more compact, a crucial factor in naval aviation,
where everything has to be squeezed into limited hangar space, although the height
needed may increase. The alternative is to ﬁt a folding tail on a conventional machine.

1.5

The essential elements

The helicopter contains a large number of systems and components, but these can
generally be broken down into a smaller number of major areas. Figure 1.19 shows
a cutaway drawing of a conventional tail rotor type helicopter. The main systems to
consider in a helicopter are the hull or airframe, the engine and transmission, the
fuel system, the landing gear, the rotors, the controls, electrical and hydraulic power,

instrumentation and avionics. These subjects will brieﬂy be introduced in the remaining sections of this chapter, and references will be made to more detailed treatments
elsewhere in the book.

1.6

The airframe

The fuselage or hull has a number of jobs to perform. One obvious task is to hold all of
the components in the correct position and to transfer forces from the rotors, the tail
surfaces, the landing gear and any internal or underslung payload. It also protects the
occupants and the mechanisms from the elements whilst still allowing good visibility
for the pilot. Space has to be found for fuel tanks close to the centre of mass (CM)
as single rotor machines are sensitive to trim shifts as fuel burns off. It will also have
a more or less aerodynamic shape, although the other requirements often combine to
prevent this. In some cases the hull will also be designed to ﬂoat in case the machine is
forced down over water, whereas in others, amphibious operation is planned.
Fuselage construction varies considerably, but the materials and techniques are not
much different from those used in any aircraft. Early machines such as the Bell 47
were no more than a steel tube lattice frame with a blown acrylic canopy for the crew.
Aerodynamic improvements came when the hull was faired in. The tail cone is often a
stressed skin structure, but the centre section has too many doors, windows and access
hatches for the skin to carry all the loads, and alloy frames or steel tubes are often
used beneath the skin. The main landing gear often shares the same framework as the
engine and transmission so that the skin is not unduly stressed on landing.
Figure 1.20 shows the structure of an Enstrom F-28. The landing skids, engine, fuel
tanks and transmission are all attached to a welded tube frame known as a pylon. A
stressed skin tail cone is attached to the rear of the pylon structure, and the aluminium
seat and cabin ﬂoor is attached to the front. The cabin is glass ﬁbre with plastics
glazing. The cabin lines are faired into the tail cone by unstressed panelling attached to
the pylon, so the machine has a sleek outline. Much of the unstressed centre panelling
can be removed for servicing.
Composite materials are ideal for airframe construction and are becoming increasingly important since they are less dense than metals and are inherently well damped,
which helps to control the inevitable vibration that characterizes helicopters. They can
also have an indeﬁnite fatigue life.

Introduction to rotorcraft 17

Fig. 1.20 The structure of a light helicopter: Enstrom F-28. See text for details.

1.7

Engine and transmission

The engine or engines and transmission are generally close together. Piston engines are
heavy, and they are almost always placed below the rotor head to balance the machine.
Turbines are much smaller and lighter and are often built into the roof of the hull to
maximize internal space. Both piston engines and turbines turn much faster than the
rotor shaft, and the transmission must incorporate reduction gearing.
The gearbox will generate a good deal of heat on a large machine, and require an oil
cooler. This will have its own air intake near the rotor shaft; often in the front of the
pylon. The gearbox also drives the tail rotor shaft, which runs the length of the tail
boom to the tail rotor gearbox. The tail rotor shaft is often mounted outside the tail
cone for ease of inspection and maintenance.
The rotors may take some time to come to rest after the engines have been shut down,
and this may be inconvenient. The civil user wants to disembark passengers with the
rotors stopped. The naval user wants to put the machine on the elevator down to the
hangar and the army user wants the rotors stopped quickly on a clandestine mission
so that the machine can be camouﬂaged. This can be achieved by ﬁtting a rotor brake
on the transmission.
Helicopters have also been built with jets at the blade tips, and this has the advantages
that no gearbox is required and there is no torque reaction. Unfortunately tip jets have
short fatigue life, very high fuel consumption and noise level to match and are little
used. They will not be considered further here.
As it is a major subject, the whole of Chapter 6 is devoted to helicopter engines and
transmissions.

1.8

The fuel system

The fuel system can be simple or complex depending on the type of machine. In early
piston engine machines using carburettors, the fuel system was little more than a pair
of tanks that fed fuel by gravity through the pilot’s cut-off valve and a ﬁlter to the
engine. The tanks in a gravity fed system are mounted one each side of the mast so that
lateral and longitudinal trim is unaffected as fuel is consumed. The tanks are clearly
visible on the Bell 47 and the Hughes 300. Larger machines will use the space below

“helic - CHAP01” — 2003/11/22 — page 17 — #17

18 The Art of the Helicopter
the ﬂoor to put tanks close to the CM, in which case pumps will be required to feed
the engines.
Piston engines burn AVGAS or aviation gasoline, which is basically similar to automobile fuel but made to tighter quality standards. Turbines burn AVTUR that has
a similar relationship to kerosene. As a piston engine will stop if AVTUR reaches it,
pilots like to know they have taken on the right fuel. AVGAS ﬁllers are marked red and
AVTUR ﬁllers are marked black to help prevent a dangerous mistake.
Recently there have been signiﬁcant advances in the development of Diesel engines,
allowing a similar power to weight ratio to a gasoline engine to be obtained. The
advantage of the aeroDiesel is that it can burn AVTUR and its improved fuel economy
allows better payload or range. A more detailed treatment of fuel systems can be found
in Chapter 6.

1.9

The landing gear

The landing gear is subject to considerable variation. Utility and training helicopters
are invariably ﬁtted with skids to allow a landing on unprepared ground even with
forward speed. Small wheels, known as ground handling wheels, can be ﬁtted so the
machine can be moved around. Some skids are broader than usual so they can act as
skis for landing on snow or soft ground. Inﬂatable or rigid ﬂoats can be attached to
the skids to permit operation over water, but there will be a drag and payload penalty.
Larger machines invariably have wheels, as skids would make them too difﬁcult to
move. Naval helicopters need wheels to allow them to be moved below decks. In many
cases the wheels can be locked so as to be tangential to a circle. The machine can be
turned into the wind, but will not roll as the ship heels.

1.10

Oleos and ground resonance

Landing gears often incorporate a telescopic section containing oil and a compressed
gas acting as a spring. These are formally known as oleo-pneumatic struts, invariably
abbreviated to oleos. When the length of the oleo changes, the oil is forced through
a small oriﬁce to damp the movement. The struts that hold up automobile tailgates
work on the same principle, but these are sealed units whereas the type of oil and the
gas pressure in an oleo may be adjusted to give the correct spring rate and damping.
One obvious purpose of the oleo is to absorb the impact of landing, but a more
important role is to control ground resonance. Ideally the rotor blades rotate with
perfectly even spacing when run up on the ground, but it is possible for them to be
disturbed from that condition. This results in the CM of the rotor moving away from
the shaft axis and the rotor tries to whirl the top of the hull in a circular orbit. Under
certain conditions this motion becomes uncontrollable unless there is damping to dissipate the energy. The origin of ground resonance will be discussed in Chapter 4 where
it will be shown that the rotor head may also need dampers to prevent the problem.

1.11

The rotors

The main rotor takes the place of the wings of a conventional aircraft, and it is not
unrealistic to think of a helicopter as being supported by the lift from wings that
rotate instead of ﬂying in a straight line. The main difference between rotor blades and

“helic - CHAP01” — 2003/11/22 — page 18 — #18

Introduction to rotorcraft 19

wings is that the former are in comparison very thin and ﬂexible, and the forces acting
upon them are greater and more rapidly varying. The rotors have more to do than an
aeroplane wing, because they are also the control system. Chapter 3 explains how the
rotors produce lift and introduces the control of the machine.

1.12

The control system

The control system cannot be treated in isolation, but must be integrated into the design
of a machine from the outset. In the pure helicopter, control of the machine is achieved
entirely by changing the pitch of the main and tail rotor blades in various ways. This will
then determine the amount of engine power needed. The rotors are generally designed
to turn at constant speed and the throttle setting will have to be modiﬁed whenever the
rotor power demand changes so that the speed does not change. Chapter 6 considers
engines and power control.
There are two main forces acting on a helicopter, the force due to gravity, which is
always downwards, and the rotor thrust vector, which is always at right angles to the
tip path plane, otherwise called the rotor disc. Chapter 2 explains how the result of
forces acting in various ways can be predicted and Chapter 3 shows how rotors develop
thrust. The pilot can control the magnitude of the rotor thrust with the collective pitch
lever held in his left hand, and the direction of the rotor thrust with the cyclic stick
held in his right hand. The cyclic stick works in two dimensions: if the stick is pushed
in any direction, the rotor thrust tilts the same way. These two fundamental controls
are illustrated in Figure 1.21.
The blade movements necessary to produce lift and to achieve control will be outlined
in Chapter 3, whereas Chapter 4 treats the construction and dynamics of the blades

Fig. 1.21 The fundamental rotor controls. The cyclic stick tilts the rotor in the direction it is moved, whereas
the collective lever changes the magnitude of the thrust.

“helic - CHAP01” — 2003/11/22 — page 19 — #19

20 The Art of the Helicopter
and rotor head. Chapter 7 integrates the control system and considers power assistance
and auto-stabilization.
The pilot controls the yaw axis by altering the pitch of the tail rotor blades using foot
pedals. Chapter 5 considers the tail system of the helicopter.
It should be mentioned in passing that the No. 1 pilot in a helicopter conventionally
occupies the right hand seat; the opposite of aeroplane practice. In some early machines,
only one collective lever was provided, between the seats. The test pilots would sit in the
left seat, as per aeroplane practice. Because of the difﬁculty of reversing the function of
left and right hands, a pilot under training would be placed in the right seat and so the
right seat became the conventional location for a helicopter pilot. A further factor is
that in early helicopters, the forces fed back to the cyclic stick from the rotor were such
that it was not safe to let go of the stick for an instant. However, the collective lever
could be released temporarily. Given that most secondary controls such as the radio
and instruments are centrally disposed so that pilot and co-pilot can both see them, it
made sense to put the pilot in command on the right where his free left hand would be of
most use.

1.13

Electrical and hydraulic system

The power systems of a typical helicopter are not that much different from those of
any aircraft. Electrical power is needed for instruments, radios, autopilots, lighting,
engine starting, navigation and intercom systems, as well as a host of further avionics
that might be needed for special purposes.
A light helicopter may have no power assistance, but as machines get larger the
control forces may cause fatigue and in very large machines they will be beyond the
strength of the pilot. Power-assisted controls then become essential. Power controls
are also needed if some kind of automatic stabilization or autopilot is ﬁtted so that the
low powered electronic signals can operate the controls.
When powered controls operated by electrical signals have faultless reliability, the
mechanical controls from the pilot can also be replaced by electrical controls, leading to
the concept of ﬂy-by-wire. The pilot operates controls having no mechanical connection
to the rotors, but which instead produce electrical signals. This concept is explored in
Chapter 7.
Electric motors are useful for low powered control purposes such as the trim mechanism, but hydraulics allows greater forces to be developed within small actuators, and
so they will be used for powered ﬂying controls.
Electrical and hydraulic power is vital to the safety of the machine, and the hydraulic
pump and the generator may be driven from the rotor shaft so that power is still available
even in the case of engine failure. In small machines the generator is driven from the
engine, as battery capacity is enough to keep the electrical system working in the case
of an engine failure. Larger machines may have two or more engines and each will have
a generator so that electric power is still available in case of engine failure.
The electrical system is discussed in Chapter 6, and an explanation of hydraulic
controls will be found in Chapter 7.

1.14

Instruments and avionics

Many of the instruments ﬁtted to helicopters are the same as those used in other
aircraft, but in addition to the usual engine-related gauges the helicopter will also need

“helic - CHAP01” — 2003/11/22 — page 20 — #20

Introduction to rotorcraft 21

a rotor tachometer. The response of a helicopter to control inputs depends on rotor
speed, and this needs to be controlled to close limits. The rotor tachometer and enginerelated instruments are detailed in Chapter 6, whereas ﬂight instruments are covered
in Chapter 7.

Technical background
This chapter provides an introduction to concepts that will be needed to follow the
technical explanations in the rest of the book.

2.1 Introduction to mechanics
Mechanics is the study of how objects interact with the forces applied to them. Designers
are concerned with resisting the forces generated in ﬂight so that the machine stays
intact. Using the controls of a helicopter the pilot changes the forces applied to it and
thereby determines the path it takes. It is important for a pilot to understand some
mechanics so that he can predict what control movements will be necessary to make
the machine do what is wanted. When this happens, the pilot is said to be in control.
Any other situation is not recommended.

2.2 Mass and density
The amount of matter in a body is speciﬁed by its mass, measured in pounds (lb) or
kilograms (kg). Since the amount of matter in a body cannot readily change, the mass
is the same wherever the body is and however it moves. The density of a substance is
the mass of unit volume. In the old imperial units, density was expressed as pounds
per cubic foot. In the SI system, the term ‘relative density’ is used, where water has a
relative density of one.

2.3 Force and acceleration
Weight is the force a body exerts on its supports. In orbit, objects have no supports:
they are weightless. Back on earth the gravitational ﬁeld pulls them down and they
have weight. Weight is equal to mass multiplied by the strength of the gravitational
ﬁeld. This is why astronauts can bounce around on the moon; gravity is much weaker
there. Since the strength of gravity doesn’t change much from one place on earth
to another, earthlings tend to buy things by weight not by mass, and often confuse
the two.
All real objects, helicopters included, have their mass distributed over their dimensions. Whilst each part has its own mass, for some purposes this can be replaced by a
single mass located at the centre of mass (CM) (Figure 2.1(a)). The older term centre

mass (CM). The mass centroid (b) is a line joining the centres of mass of thin slices through the body.

of gravity (CG) will also be found, but this is incorrect as objects still have a centre of
mass in the absence of a gravitational ﬁeld. If a body is imagined to be divided into
a series of slices, each slice will have a CM. Figure 2.1(b) shows that the line joining
all of these CMs is known as the mass centroid. The location of the mass centroid is
important in blade design and in balancing rotating assemblies.
The speed of an object is the rate at which it covers distance, and the direction is
immaterial. In contrast, velocity is the rate at which distance is covered in a speciﬁc
direction. Any quantity that also has direction is called a vector. Acceleration is the rate
of change of velocity, so it must be a vector. Acceleration can come about by keeping
the direction the same and changing the speed, or by keeping the speed the same and
changing the direction. The force necessary to change velocity is equal to the mass
multiplied by the acceleration:
F =m×a
In SI units, the unit of force is the Newton (N). This is deﬁned as the force that will
cause a mass of one kilogram to accelerate at one metre per second per second.
On the surface of the earth, a mass of 1 kg experiences a gravitational attraction
of about 9.81 N. Consequently any object released at a height will accelerate downwards at 9.81 metres per second per second. This downward acceleration, commonly
called falling, can be prevented by opposing gravity with an upward force of 9.81 N.
Figure 2.2(a) shows what happens. The object is supported by upward force opposing
its weight. Clearly force is a vector quantity. When the two forces are exactly equal
and opposite, the object is in equilibrium: the resultant force and the acceleration are
both nil.
Consider an elevator in a high-rise building. When the elevator starts, the motor
applies a greater upward force to the occupants than gravity applies downwards.

24 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 2.2 Weight is the force a body exerts on its supports. At (a) the weight is equal to the supporting force
and there is no resultant. At (b) upward acceleration requires a greater force than in (a) so the weight appears
to increase. At (c), downward acceleration causes weight to reduce. Note that the mass does not change, but
the weight does.

Figure 2.2(b) shows that there is no longer a balance of forces, so there is no equilibrium.
The difference between the force of gravity and the greater force from the ﬂoor of the
elevator accelerates us upwards. We feel the extra load on our feet: temporarily our
weight has increased. As the elevator approaches the desired level, the motor will reduce
power, and the force it applies will be less than that due to gravity. Figure 2.2(c) shows
that the resultant force is now downwards, and our ascent is slowed until we stop.
Momentarily our weight is reduced: we feel light on our feet. Note that as the elevator
slows we are going upwards but accelerating downwards. There is no contradiction
here; acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
Figure 2.3 shows what happens to an object having mass when forces act on it to
accelerate and decelerate it. As there is always a reaction to the application of a force,
if force is applied to an object in order to accelerate it, the reaction will attempt to
accelerate whatever is supplying the force the opposite way. Figure 2.4 shows some
examples. The recoil of a gun is the reaction to accelerating the shell. The thrust of
a ship’s propeller is the reaction to accelerating water backwards. A helicopter stays
airborne by accelerating air downwards: the reaction is upwards, and if it is equal to
the force due to gravity, the helicopter is in equilibrium. Note that the helicopter is
not weightless, its weight is acting on the air around it as the substantial downwash
indicates.

2.4 Strength and rigidity
In aircraft, various forces must be resisted by the structure. The ability of a material
to resist forces is measured with respect to unit cross-sectional area, typically a square
metre. The force applied per unit of area is known as the stress. Figure 2.5 shows that as
the force applied to unit area increases, initially there will be a proportional elongation
according to Hooke’s Law. The elongation per unit length is known as the strain. The
constant of proportionality is known as the stiffness. In the linear region, the material
recovers its dimensions when the stress is removed. If the stress is further increased,
the strength of the material may be exceeded and an irreversible extension, known as
plasticity, may take place, leading ﬁnally to breakage. In brittle materials, the plastic
region may be negligibly small.
A structure that can resist a given static load may eventually suffer fatigue failure
if the load is repeatedly applied and removed. In practice a safety factor must be
applied to the maximum stress and the life of the component may be restricted to a
certain number of cycles. Fatigue primarily occurs in parts under tensile stress, probably
because this condition encourages the spreading of cracks. Highly stressed components

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 25 — #4

26 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 2.5 Elongation is initially proportional to stress, followed by differing characteristics according to whether
the material is ductile or brittle.

such as rotor heads may need extremely ﬁne ﬁnishing and surface treatment to minimize
any irregularities from which a crack might propagate. Periodic inspection of highly
stressed parts may be needed. Cracks can be detected by X-rays, ultrasonic testing or
by penetrating dyes. At high temperatures, materials working within their elastic limit
may creep if the load is sustained. This phenomenon limits the life of turbine blades.
In many cases it is not the ability of the component to resist the load that matters,
but the amount of deﬂection the load is allowed to cause. Unwanted deﬂections are
generally unwelcome in aircraft as they may result in ﬂutter or imprecise control.
Consequently stiff materials are advantageous. All aircraft have to lift themselves as well
as any payload, so it is an advantage if the weight of the structure can be minimized. It is
often thought that this will be achieved using low density materials, but this is not always
the case. In practice the lowest weight will be achieved by using materials with a high
stiffness to relative density ratio. This ratio also controls the speed of sound in the material, which is generally high in aerospace materials as can easily be established by tapping them. The result is a sound of a higher pitch than that found in everyday materials.
Such materials also make good loudspeaker cones, where the same criteria apply.
In practice the designer would like to have a range of materials all having high stiffness
to relative density ratio, but with a range of relative densities and strengths. Where
stresses are concentrated, a high strength, high density material is used. Where stresses
are reduced, a lower density material will be superior. For example, if a component were
made from an excessively strong material, the thickness required to carry the design
load might be so small that the component might suffer handling damage. Honeycomb
and foam cored materials are one approach to reducing density. In a helicopter, the
density of materials used tends to fall with distance from the rotor axis.

2.5 Resultants and components of forces
Earlier in this chapter, the forces were either up or down in order to introduce one
concept at a time. In the real world forces can act in arbitrary directions, except for the

Fig. 2.6 Forces are vectors having direction and magnitude represented by the length of an arrow. At (a) the
resultant of two forces AB and AC can be found by drawing CD parallel to AB and BE parallel to AC. This
completes the parallelogram CABR and the diagonal AR represents the resultant. At (b) a force AE equal and
opposite to the diagonal will cancel the other two forces. At (c) a single force can be resolved into forces in two
orthogonal directions.

force due to gravity, which doggedly remains pointed downwards. When several forces
are acting, it is possible to ﬁnd out what happens by determining the direction and
magnitude of the resultant force.
Figure 2.6 shows how forces are represented. An arrow is drawn in the direction of
each force, and the length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude. In this case
two different forces act on the same point, and in different directions. We can ﬁnd the
resultant force, which is a single force having the same effect as the others together, by
completing the parallelogram as shown, and drawing in the diagonal. The body will
accelerate in the direction of the resultant. Alternatively, by drawing a force of equal
length to the resultant but in the opposite direction, we have found the force needed to
maintain equilibrium with the other two.
The opposite of ﬁnding a resultant to two forces is splitting a single force into two
different ones. This is known as resolving, and the two forces are known as components.
It is common to resolve an arbitrary force into horizontal and vertical components.
The ﬁgure shows that it is easy to do. Horizontal and vertical lines are drawn from
both ends of the force arrow. The intersection of the lines shows the magnitude of the
horizontal and vertical components of the force.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 27 — #6

28 The Art of the Helicopter

2.6 Moments and couples
So far only forces that all conveniently act at one point have been considered. In reality
forces can also act at a distance from a point. When a force does not pass through a point
the result is called a moment with respect to that point. The moment is equal to the force
multiplied by the distance at right angles to the force, as shown in Figure 2.7. Applying
a moment to an object will cause it to turn and accelerate along simultaneously.
If two equal and opposite forces act a distance apart, the result is a pure turning
effort known as a couple or as torque. A helicopter engine produces a couple at the
output shaft in order to drive the blades. The reaction to this couple attempts to twist
the engine against its mountings. The transmission conveys the engine power to the
rotor shaft. The rotor shaft exerts a couple on the rotor head in order to drive the
blades round. The torque reaction to this couple attempts to rotate the transmission,
and the helicopter hanging from it, the opposite way. One of the jobs of the designer is
to ﬁnd a means to prevent this rotation.
When a body is supported at the CM, it will remain in the initial attitude. Figure 2.8
shows that if the support is not at the CM, the body will rotate. It may swing from side
to side, but eventually will come to rest with the CM below the point of support.
It is often assumed that the CM of the helicopter is below the rotor shaft, but this
may not be the case. Figure 2.9 shows how a helicopter hovers with the CM displaced.
The CM tends to hang directly beneath the rotor head, and the pilot has to displace
the cyclic control in order to keep the disc horizontal so the rotor thrust vector is
straight up. Clearly if the CM is a long way from the mast, a substantial amount of
cyclic control will be used up to compensate, and there may not be enough left to
control the machine. In addition the bearings and joints in the rotor head ﬁnd it harder
to transmit power when the shaft and the disc are not aligned.

Fig. 2.7 (a) A moment about a point is the product of the force and the distance. (b) A pure couple results from
two equal and opposite forces that do not coincide.

Fig. 2.8 (a) A body supported at a point not above the CM will swing until the CM is below the support as in (b).

Fig. 2.9 In a hovering helicopter, if the CM is displaced, the mast will have to tilt until the CM is below the
thrust line of the rotor.

For all these reasons, the CM position of a helicopter is important. Taking on
passengers, fuel and payload can move the CM of the machine. It is the responsibility of the commander to ensure that the CM of the helicopter is within the limits
laid down by the authorities for the machine in question.

2.7 Work, energy, power and momentum
In everyday speech these terms are used with a variety of meanings, but in mechanics
their meanings are much more closely deﬁned. Work is done when a resultant force
moves through a distance. A table supporting objects placed on it does no work on
them because although there is a force holding them up, there is no movement. A crane
lifting an object does work because the force of gravity is opposed throughout the
distance the load is lifted.
Energy is a measure of the ability to do work. Sometimes the interchange between
work and energy is reversible. Burning fuel releases energy that allows an engine to
do work. This is not reversible. A wound-up spring holds the energy that drives a
clock. A helicopter battery holds enough energy to start the engine. These are both

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 29 — #8

30 The Art of the Helicopter
reversible. Work is done winding the spring or charging the battery and this is turned
into stored energy, most of which can later be released to do work.
Energy can also be stored in the position and motion of objects. If a weight is lifted
against gravity, it stores potential energy that can be released when the weight is lowered
again. Potential energy is proportional to the height through which the object is lifted.
If a weight is accelerated, the resultant force acting on it moves through a distance
and does work which is stored as kinetic energy. Figure 2.10 shows a mass being
accelerated from rest by a constant force F over a distance s in time t up to a velocity v.
The kinetic energy of the mass is equal to the work done on it. This is equal to the
product of force F multiplied by distance s.
Since F = m × a, then KE = m × a × s.
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, thus a = v/t. Since the velocity increases
uniformly then distance s is the time multiplied by the average speed, thus s = 21 v × t.
KE = m × a × s = m ×

m · v2

Kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity. Power is the rate at which
work is done or the rate at which energy is released, which is the same thing. Thus a
high powered engine will burn fuel at a higher rate in order to release more energy in
a given time.
The ﬁnal quantity to be considered is momentum. This is equal to the mass multiplied
by the velocity. The use of momentum will better be explained when the topic of lift
generation is dealt with in Chapter 3.
A helicopter in ﬂight has both kinetic and potential energy. This energy was stored
in the helicopter by doing work against the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. Thus the helicopter’s potential and kinetic energy exists with respect to the earth and Newton’s laws
determine what the helicopter will do with respect to the earth when forces act upon it.
The earth is the inertial frame of reference.
Other than gravity, the forces when airborne can only come from the movement of
the machine and its rotors with respect to the air. In still air the aerodynamic frame
of reference and the earth’s frame of reference are the same and this simpliﬁes matters.
However, when considering a machine ﬂying in the presence of a wind, it is important
to realize that the wind means that the aerodynamic frame of reference is moving with
respect to the inertial frame of reference.
The reader is cautioned against texts that erroneously claim that the helicopter ﬂies
only with respect to the air because it doesn’t know what the ground is doing and that
all that matters is airspeed. If this were true artiﬁcial horizons and inertial navigators
wouldn’t work.

Fig. 2.10 A mass being accelerated will gather kinetic energy (KE) as derived here.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 30 — #9

Technical background 31

Fig. 2.11 At (a) a helicopter ﬂying at 30 kt into a 30 kt wind is doing 30 kt aerodynamically but inertially it is
hovering. At (b), ﬂying downwind the aerodynamic conditions are the same but the machine has KE corresponding
to 60 kt.

Figure 2.11(a) shows a helicopter ﬂying at 30 knots directly into a 30 knot wind.
Aerodynamically it is doing 30 knots but inertially it is stationary and has no kinetic
energy. Inertially it is hovering. Figure 2.11(b) shows a helicopter ﬂying at 30 knots
down wind in a 30 knot wind. Aerodynamically the conditions are the same, but inertially the machine is now doing 60 knots and possesses the kinetic energy due to that
groundspeed. The difference in kinetic energy becomes obvious when an attempt is
made to change heading. If the helicopter in (b) does a 180◦ turn, it will conserve its
kinetic energy and will exit the turn with 60 knots of groundspeed and 90 knots on
the ASI. The result will be that the machine will tend to climb as the surplus airspeed
is converted to potential energy.
If the helicopter in (a) tries a 180◦ turn it will be in difﬁculty and will lose height
because it lacks 60 knots worth of kinetic energy. If the machine isn’t powerful and
doesn’t have height to lose it could crash. And the pilot who thought that the helicopter
doesn’t know what the ground is doing wouldn’t know what he did wrong.

2.8 Efﬁciency
Efﬁciency is generally deﬁned as the ratio of useful output power to input power in any
mechanism. In the case of a gearbox the useful power is the output shaft power. This
will always be less than the input power and the difference will be converted to heat.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 31 — #10

32 The Art of the Helicopter
In the case of an engine, the input power is the heat released by burning the fuel.
In practical engines, this exceeds the output shaft power considerably. The percentage
of the thermal energy in the fuel that emerges as shaft power is the thermal efﬁciency
of the engine. The waste heat has to be removed by a cooling system to prevent the
temperature of the engine rising to the point where components are damaged. Cooling
systems waste further power in driving fans and pumps and usually increase the drag
of the airframe.
Given the necessary high power to weight ratio in helicopters, the power plant and
fuel form a signiﬁcant part of the all-up weight. It is beneﬁcial to explore means to
improve the thermal efﬁciency of the engine. Not only will this reduce the weight of
the fuel to be carried for a given range, but it may also allow the cooling system to be
lighter, to consume less power and to cause less intake drag. Thus a small improvement
in thermal efﬁciency may result in a signiﬁcant increase in performance.
Passenger aircraft may be compared using speciﬁc air range (the mass of fuel used per
unit of distance), but in a hovering helicopter this ﬁgure is meaningless. In helicopters,
it may be better to compare the power actually used to hover with the theoretical power
needed by an ideal rotor under the same conditions.

2.9 Gases and the atmosphere
The atmosphere is the medium in which helicopters ﬂy but it is also one of the fuels
for the engine and the occupants breathe it. It is a highly variable medium that is
constantly being forced out of equilibrium by heat from the sun and in which the
pressure, temperature, and humidity can vary with height and with time and in which
winds blow in complex time- and height-variant patterns. The effect of atmospheric
conditions on ﬂight is so signiﬁcant that no pilot can obtain qualiﬁcations without
demonstrating a working knowledge of these effects.
The atmosphere is a mixture of gases. About 78% is nitrogen – a relatively unreactive
element – whereas about 21% is oxygen, which is highly reactive. The remainder is a
mixture of water in the gaseous state and various other traces. The reactive nature of
oxygen is both good and bad. The good part is that it provides a source of energy
for life and helicopters alike because hydrocarbons can react with oxygen to release
energy. The bad part is that many materials will react with oxygen when we would
rather they didn’t. Chemically, combustion and corrosion are one and the same thing.
The difference is based on the human reaction to the chemical reaction.
Gases are the highest energy state of matter, for example the application of energy
to ice produces water and the application of more energy produces water vapour. The
reason that a gas takes up so much more room than a liquid is that the molecules
contain so much energy that they break free from their neighbours and rush around at
a high speed, which is a function of absolute temperature. As Figure 2.12(a) shows, the
innumerable elastic collisions of these high speed molecules produce pressure on the
walls of any gas container. In fact the distance a molecule can go without a collision,
the mean free path, is quite short at atmospheric pressure. Consequently gas molecules
also collide with each other elastically, so that if left undisturbed, in a container at a
constant temperature, every molecule would end up with essentially the same energy
and the pressure throughout would be constant and uniform.
Pressure is measured by physicists and by engineers in units of force per unit of area
using imperial units of pounds per square inch or SI units of Newtons per square metre.
At sea level, the atmosphere exerts a pressure of about 15 pounds per square inch
and has a density of about 0.075 pounds per cubic foot or in metric units about

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 32 — #11

Technical background 33

Fig. 2.12 (a) The pressure exerted by a gas is due to countless elastic collisions between gas molecules
and the walls of the container. (b) If the wall moves against the gas pressure, the rebound velocity increases.
(c) Motion with the gas pressure reduces the particle velocity.

100 000 Newtons per square metre with a density of 1.225 kg per cubic metre. Over the
years, many other units of pressure have evolved, some from meteorology. One of these
is the bar (after barometry) where one bar is the average atmospheric pressure at the
place where the bar was deﬁned. In practical use, the bar is divided into one thousand
millibars. The bar is slowly being replaced by a numerically identical unit known as
the hectoPascal (hPa). The bar and hPa are commonly used in aviation altimetry. The
principle of the mercury barometer is that atmospheric pressure supports a column of
mercury exposed to a vacuum at the top. Consequently the length of the column is
proportional to pressure and can be expressed in inches or cm of mercury. At sea level
a reading of about 26 inches of mercury is obtained. This unit may be found in use in
altimeters originating in the United States.
The Gas Law states that the product of pressure and volume is proportional to
temperature. Reducing the volume means that external work has to be done to oppose
the pressure. This work increases the temperature of the gas. The Diesel engine obtains
ignition in this way. Conversely if the volume is increased, work is done by the expansion
of the gas and the temperature must fall. This is why carburettors are prone to icing on
part throttle because the air expands on entering the manifold. Air conditioners work
in the same way.
If the volume is ﬁxed, as temperature rises, the velocity of the molecules increases
and so the impact at each collision with the walls of any container is greater and the
pressure rises. Alternatively the same pressure can be exerted in a given volume with a
smaller mass of gas. Thus in the atmosphere where pressure increases can be released
by free movement, the result of an increase in air temperature is that the density goes
down. Density is also affected by humidity. Water molecules are heavier than those of
atmospheric gases and increase the pressure due to molecular collisions. Thus in the
presence of water vapour a given pressure can be sustained with a smaller mass of air
and the density goes down.

2.10 Sound
Sound is simply an airborne version of vibration which is why the two topics are
inextricably linked. Sound disturbs the equilibrium of a gas, as does the creation of lift.
Not surprisingly, aerostats excepted, all ﬂying objects make a noise as a by-product of
creating lift. Consequently there is a great deal of overlap between aerodynamics and
acoustics.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 33 — #12

34 The Art of the Helicopter
Figure 2.12(b) shows that a solid object that moves against gas pressure increases
the velocity of the rebounding molecules, whereas in (c) one moving with gas pressure
reduces that velocity. The average velocity and the displacement of all the molecules
in a layer of air near to a moving body is the same as the velocity and displacement
of the body. Movement of a body results in a local increase, or decrease, in pressure.
Thus sound is both a pressure and a velocity disturbance. Integration of the velocity
disturbance gives the displacement.
Despite the fact that a gas contains endlessly colliding molecules, a small mass or
particle of gas can have stable characteristics if molecules leave and are replaced by
others having identical properties. As a result aerodynamics and acoustics seldom need
to consider the molecular structure of air and the constant motion can be neglected.
Thus when particle velocity and displacement is considered in aerodynamics or acoustics, this refers to the average values of a large number of molecules. In an undisturbed
container of gas the particle velocity and displacement will both be zero everywhere.
When the volume of a ﬁxed mass of gas is reduced, the pressure rises. The gas acts
like a spring; it is compliant. However, a gas also has mass. Sound travels through air
by an interaction between the mass and the compliance. Imagine pushing a mass via
a spring. It would not move immediately because the spring would have to be compressed in order to transmit a force. If a second mass were to be connected to the ﬁrst
by another spring, it would start to move even later. Thus the speed of a disturbance
in a mass/spring system depends on the mass and the stiffness. Sound travels through
air without a net movement of the air.
After the disturbance had propagated the masses would return to their rest position.
The mass/spring analogy is helpful for a basic understanding, but is too simple to
account for commonly encountered acoustic phenomena such as spherically expanding
waves.
Unlike solids, the elasticity of gas is a complicated process. If a ﬁxed mass of gas is
compressed, work has to be done on it. This will generate heat in the gas. If the heat
is allowed to escape and the compression does not change the temperature, the process is
said to be isothermal. However, if the heat cannot escape the temperature will rise and
give a disproportionate increase in pressure. This process is said to be adiabatic and
the Diesel engine depends upon it. In most acoustic cases there is insufﬁcient time for
much heat transfer and so air is considered to act adiabatically. Figure 2.13 shows how
the speed of sound c in air can be derived by calculating its elasticity under adiabatic
conditions.

Fig. 2.13 Calculating the speed of sound from the elasticity of air.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 34 — #13

Technical background 35

If the volume allocated to a given mass of gas is reduced isothermally, the pressure
and the density will rise by the same amount so that c does not change. If the temperature is raised at constant pressure, the density goes down and so the speed of sound
goes up. Gases with lower density than air have a higher speed of sound. Divers who
breathe a mixture of oxygen and helium to prevent ‘the bends’ must accept that the
pitch of their voices rises remarkably.
The speed of sound is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature.
At sea level the speed of sound is typically about 1000 feet per second or 344 metres
per second. Temperature falls with altitude in the atmosphere and with it the speed of
sound. The local speed of sound is deﬁned as Mach 1.
As air acts adiabatically, a propagating sound wave causes cyclic temperature changes.
The speed of sound is a function of temperature, yet sound causes a temperature
variation. One might expect some effects because of this. Sounds below the threshold
of pain have such a small pressure variation compared with atmospheric pressure that
the effect is negligible and air can be assumed to be linear. However, on any occasion
where the pressures are higher, a situation not unknown in aviation, this is not a valid
assumption. In such cases the positive half cycle signiﬁcantly increases local temperature and the speed of sound, whereas the negative half cycle reduces temperature and
velocity. Figure 2.14 shows that this results in signiﬁcant distortion of a sine wave,
ultimately causing a shock wave that can travel faster than the speed of sound until the
pressure has dissipated with distance. This effect is responsible for the sharp sound of
a handclap and for the sonic boom of a supersonic aircraft.
Whilst the hulls of helicopters do not approach the speed of sound, their rotor
blade tips certainly do and the effects of this have to be taken into account. The drag
on a rotor blade at moderate speeds increases as the square of the relative airspeed but as
Mach 1 is approached the drag increases disproportionately; an effect called compressibility. This is intuitively understandable as the air has less time to get out of the way
when the disturbances that propagate ahead of the blade are travelling a little faster
than the blade itself. In extremely cold weather, or at high altitude, the speed of sound
falls and helicopters with high tip speeds will suffer a loss of efﬁciency.
Sound can be due to a one-off event known as percussion, or a periodic event such as
the sinusoidal vibration of a tuning fork. The sound due to percussion is called transient
whereas a periodic stimulus produces steady-state sound having a frequency f .

Fig. 2.14 At high level, sound distorts itself by increasing the speed of propagation on positive half cycles.
The result is a shock wave.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 35 — #14

36 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 2.15 Wavelength is deﬁned as the distance between two points at the same place on adjacent cycles.
Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency.

Because sound travels at a ﬁnite speed, the ﬁxed observer at some distance from the
source will experience the disturbance at some later time. In the case of a transient, the
observer will detect a single replica of the original as it passes at the speed of sound.
In the case of the tuning fork, a periodic sound source, the pressure peaks and dips
follow one another away from the source at the speed of sound. For a given rate of
vibration of the source, a given peak will have propagated a constant distance before
the next peak occurs. This distance is called the wavelength lambda. Figure 2.15 shows
that wavelength is deﬁned as the distance between any two identical points on the
whole cycle. If the source vibrates faster, successive peaks get closer together and the
wavelength gets shorter. The wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency.
It is easy to remember that the wavelength of 1000 Hz is a foot (about 30 cm) at sea
level.

2.11 The mechanics of oscillation
By deﬁnition helicopters contain a lot of rotating parts and for a proper understanding
of their characteristics, knowledge of the mechanics of rotation is essential. In physics,
the engineering quantity of RPM is not used. Instead the unit of angular velocity is
radians per second and the symbol used is ω. Figure 2.16 shows that a radian is a
natural unit of angle which is the angle subtended by unit circumference at unit radius.
As the circumference is given by 2π times the radius, then there will be 2π radians in
one revolution, such that one radian is about 57◦ .
Figure 2.17 shows a constant speed rotation viewed along the axis so that the motion
is circular. Imagine, however, the view from one side in the plane of the rotation. From a
distance, only a vertical oscillation will be observed and if the position is plotted against
time the resultant waveform will be a sine wave. The sine wave is unique because it
contains only a single frequency. All other waveforms contain more than one frequency.
Imagine a second viewer who is at right angles to the ﬁrst viewer. He will observe
the same waveform, but at a different time. The displacement is given by multiplying
the radius by the cosine of the phase angle. When plotted on the same graph, the two
waveforms are phase shifted with respect to one another. In this case the phase shift is
90◦ and the two waveforms are said to be in quadrature. Incidentally the motions on
each side of a steam locomotive are in quadrature so that it can always get started (the
term used is quartering). Note that the phase angle of a signal is constantly changing
with time whereas the phase shift between two signals can be constant. It is important
that these two are not confused. In a three-bladed rotor, the motion of each blade

Fig. 2.17 A sine wave is one component of a rotation. When a rotation is viewed from two places at right
angles, one will see a sine wave and the other will see a cosine wave. The constant phase shift between sine
and cosine is 90◦ and should not be confused with the time variant phase angle due to the rotation.

would be phase shifted by 120◦ from that of the next blade, whereas the phase angle of
a blade changes continuously as it rotates. In helicopters the phase angle is taken to be
the angle between the blade and a line drawn directly aft from the rotor hub.
Geometrically it is possible to calculate the height or displacement of the sine wave in
Figure 2.17 because it is given by the radius multiplied by the sine of the phase angle. The
phase angle is obtained by multiplying the angular velocity ω by the time t. Frequency
f is measured in rotations per second or Hertz (Hz). Thus the phase angle at a time t
is given by ωt or 2πft.
A rotating object is not in static equilibrium even if the RPM is constant. With the
exception of those elements of the object which are on the axis of rotation, all other
elements are in a constant state of acceleration because their velocity is constantly
changing as they follow a curved path. Figure 2.18(a) shows that if an arbitrary increment of time is taken, the velocity at the beginning is different from that at the end
and a small resultant vector is necessary to close the triangle. As the time increment

Fig. 2.18 A body following a circular path is at constant acceleration and if this is calculated, it can be used
to derive the forces acting. (a) shows that after a short time δT , the velocity has changed direction. (b) The rate
of change of velocity is the acceleration. (c) shows that if δT is allowed to fall to zero, the acceleration points
to the centre of rotation.

becomes vanishingly small this vector will be seen to point to the axis of rotation as
can be seen in (c).
As the RPM increases, the length of the velocity vectors in Figure 2.18 increases in
proportion to RPM, as does the angle between them. As the resultant for small angles
is the product of the vector length multiplied by the angle between them, it is easy to
see that the acceleration or rate of change of velocity is proportional to the square of
the RPM. The advantage of the use of ω to measure angular velocity is that if this is
done the velocity at any radius r is simply ω × r and the acceleration is simply ω2 × r.
There are no constants or conversion factors to remember which is a major advantage
of the MKS metric system.
It was shown above that F = m × a, it can be seen that the inward or centripetal
(Latin: centre seeking) force needed to accelerate an object in a circular path is simply:
F = m × ω2 × r

as ω = v/r

then F = m × v2 /r

When a mass moves along, or translates, it has kinetic energy. When an object rotates,
it also has kinetic energy, but the amount is less easy to calculate. This is because all
elements of a translating mass move at the same velocity, whereas in a rotating mass
different elements move at different velocities according to how far from the axis they
are. By adding up all of the kinetic energies of blade elements at different velocities, the
kinetic energy of the rotor can be found. If an elemental mass δm is rotating at radius r
with angular velocity ω, its velocity is ω × r and so its kinetic energy must be:
δm × ω2 × r2
2
An arbitrary body can be treated as a collection of such masses at various radii and
the integral of the kinetic energies of all of these gives the total kinetic energy. If this
is divided by the square of the angular velocity the result is the moment of inertia;
the rotational equivalent of mass. Any rotating body could have the same moment
of inertia if all of its mass instead were concentrated at one radius from the axis of
rotation. This is known as the radius of gyration.
The rotor blade requires an inward or centripetal force to accelerate it into a circular
path. Each element of the blade is at a different radius and so calculating the overall

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 38 — #17

Technical background 39

force would be complicated were it not for the fact that the blade mass appears for this
purpose to be concentrated at the radius of gyration. The ﬁgures for root tension are
quite impressive. In a typical model helicopter a tension of 500 N is normal. In a full
size helicopter 100 000 N is not unusual.
When a body of arbitrary shape is rotated, if the centre of mass is not on the axis
of rotation, forces must come from the bearings to accelerate the CM into a circular
path. This is the origin of vibration due to imbalance. In space no such forces can be
applied and the only way the rotation can occur is for the CM and the axis to align.
Thus rotating devices try to achieve such alignment and vibration results when bearings
prevent it.
Figure 2.19(a) shows that a simple balancing process consists of supporting the
assembly with the axis horizontal. If the CM does not coincide, gravity will turn the
assembly until the CM is beneath. Balance weights may be added until the assembly
will stay where it is left. In this condition the assembly is statically balanced, with no net
moments, but it may still vibrate when rotated. Figure 2.19(b) shows that a statically
balanced assembly can result with masses at different places along the axis of rotation.
This will be imbalanced when rotating.
The statically balanced body in Figure 2.19(b) will try to rotate along its mass
centroid. To eliminate vibration, the body must be dynamically balanced. This means

Fig. 2.19 Static balance (a) can be achieved when no overall moment results about the axis of rotation. (b) A
statically balanced system that will vibrate when rotated as it is not dynamically balanced and will tend to
turn about its mass centroid. (c) In model helicopters, dynamic balance is achieved by adding a small piece of
covering material. The mass needed is equal to the difference in mass of the two blades, and the position is
such that the blades balance in the same place.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 39 — #18

40 The Art of the Helicopter
that weights are added at various places along the axis to bring the CM of the slices
onto the axis. When balancing car wheels, note that weights may be ﬁtted both to the
inner and outer rims to achieve this.
In the case of a helicopter rotor, the blades will be in the same plane and so the effects
due to Figure 2.19(b) will be small. However, a statically balanced rotor could still be
achieved if one blade were heavier than the other, if its CM were nearer the shaft. Thus
to dynamically balance a rotor, it is necessary that all of the blades should have exactly
the same mass, and the same radius of gyration. This means that the distribution
of mass along and across each blade should be identical and the CM should be at the
same point in three axes. In full size rotor blades, weight pockets are provided at various
places to allow these conditions to be met.
In model helicopters dynamic balancing is just as important, but a simpliﬁed
approach can be used. Figure 2.19(c) shows that the blades must be carefully weighed,
and a piece of covering material is cut to have exactly the same mass as the difference
in masses of the blades. The blades are assembled to the balanced rotor head, and
the covering material is applied to the lighter blade at a point where static balance is
achieved. It will then be found that the two blades have their CM in the same place and
so the rotor will be dynamically balanced. The same result will be obtained if the covering is moved until both blades balance in the same place. In full-size helicopters
the leading edge of the blade may be protected with a replaceable plastic ﬁlm. If
part of this comes off or the ﬁlm is not ﬁtted identically to each blade, vibration
may result.

2.12 The mechanics of rotation
Figure 2.20(a) shows a steady rotation which could be a mass tethered by a string.
Tension in the string causes an inward force that accelerates the mass into a circular
path. The tension can be described as a rotating vector. When viewed from the side,
the displacement about the vertical axis appears sinusoidal. The vertical component
of the tension is also sinusoidal, and out of phase with the displacement. As the two
parameters have the same waveform, they must be proportional. In other words the
restoring force acting on the mass is proportional to the displacement.

Fig. 2.20 (a) A tethered mass is moving in a circle. If the component of this motion in one axis only is resolved,
the motion will be found to be the same as a mass supported on a spring, (b).

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 40 — #19

Technical background 41

Figure 2.20(b) shows that the same characteristic is obtained if the mass is supported
on a spring. The mass supported by a spring is found widely in engineering because
structures have mass and can never be inﬁnitely rigid. An ideal spring produces a restoring force proportional to the displacement. The constant of proportionality is called
the stiffness and is the reciprocal of compliance. When such a system is displaced there
is sustained resonance. Not surprisingly the displacement is sinusoidal and is called
simple harmonic motion or SHM and has all of the characteristics of one dimension of
a rotation as shown in Figure 2.17.
The only difference between the mass on a string and the mass on a spring is that
when more energy is put into the system, the mass on a string goes faster because the
displacement cannot increase but more tension can be produced. The mass on the spring
oscillates at the same frequency but the amplitude has to increase so that the restoring
force can be greater.
The velocity of a moving component is often more important than the displacement.
The vertical component of velocity is obtained by differentiating the displacement.
As the displacement is a sine wave, the velocity will be a cosine wave whose amplitude is proportional to frequency. In other words the displacement and velocity are
in quadrature with the velocity lagging. This is consistent with the velocity reaching a minimum as the displacement reaches a maximum and vice versa. Figure 2.21

42 The Art of the Helicopter
shows the displacement, velocity and acceleration waveforms of a body executing
SHM (simple harmonic motion). Note that the acceleration and the displacement
are always anti-phase.
Eventually the resonance of a mass on a spring dies away. The faster energy is taken
out of the system, the greater the rate of decay. Any mechanism that removes energy
from a resonant system is called damping.
The motion of a rigid body can be completely determined by the mass, the stiffness
and the damping factor. It is important to consider what happens when resonant
systems are excited at different frequencies. Figure 2.22 shows the velocity and displacement of a mass-stiffness-damping system excited by a sinusoidal force of constant
amplitude acting on the mass at various frequencies. Below resonance, the frequency
of excitation is low and little force is needed to accelerate the mass. The force needed
to deﬂect the spring is greater and so the system is said to be stiffness controlled. The
amplitude is independent of frequency, described as constant amplitude operation, and
so the velocity rises proportionally to frequency below resonance.
Above resonance the inertia of the mass is greater than the stiffness of the spring and
the response of the system is described as mass controlled. With a constant force there
is constant acceleration yet as frequency rises there is less time for the acceleration to
act. Thus velocity is inversely proportional to frequency. As the displacement is the
integral of the velocity the displacement curve is tilted by an amount proportional to
frequency so that below resonance the displacement is constant and in-phase with the

Fig. 2.22 The behaviour of a mass-stiffness-damping system: (a) amplitude, (b) velocity, (c) acceleration.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 42 — #21

Technical background 43

force whereas above it is inversely proportional to the square of the frequency and is
anti-phase to the force.
In the vicinity of resonance the amplitude is a function of the damping and is said
to be resistance controlled. With no damping the Q-factor is high and the amplitude
at resonance tends to inﬁnity, resulting in a sharp peak in the response. Increasing the
damping lowers and broadens the peak so that with high damping the velocity is nearly
independent of frequency. Figure 2.23 shows the effect of different damping factors
on the step response, i.e. the response to a sudden shock. The underdamped system
enters a decaying oscillation. The overdamped system takes a considerable time to
return to rest. The critically damped system returns to rest in the shortest time possible
subject to not overshooting.
Below resonance the displacement of the spring is proportional to the force. Here
force and displacement are in phase. Above resonance the acceleration of the mass
is proportional to the force. Here force and acceleration are in phase. It will be seen
from Figure 2.22 that the velocity leads the displacement but lags the acceleration.
Consequently below resonance the velocity leads the applied force whereas above resonance it lags. Around resonance there is a phase reversal so that at the precise resonant
frequency there is no phase shift at all. Figure 2.24 shows that the rate of phase change
in the vicinity of resonance is a function of the damping.

44 The Art of the Helicopter
It will be clear that the behaviour just noted has a direct parallel in the behaviour of
an electronic damped tuned circuit consisting of an inductor, a capacitor and a resistor
and the mathematics of both are one and the same. This is more than just a convenience
because it means that an unwanted mechanical resonance or phase change in a control
system can be suppressed by incorporating at some point a suitable electronic circuit
designed to have the opposite characteristic. Additionally by converting mechanical
parameters into electrical parameters the behaviour of a mechanism can be analysed
as if it were an electronic circuit.

2.13 Sidebands
It was seen in Figure 2.17 that a sinusoidal function is a rotation resolved in one axis.
In order to obtain a purely sinusoidal motion, the motion on the other axis must be
eliminated. Conceptually this may be achieved by having a contra-rotating system in
which there is one rotation at +ω and another at −ω. Figure 2.25(a) shows that the
sine components of these two rotations will be in the same phase and will add, whereas

Fig. 2.25 (a) A sinusoidal motion can be considered as the sum of contra-rotations which cancel the cosine
components. (b) When two sinusoids are multiplied, the effect is that one rotation is carried around by the other.
A difference frequency exists because the forward rotation of one signal carries round the backward rotation of
the other which makes it slow down. The sum frequency is obviously rotating faster.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 44 — #23

Technical background 45

the cosine components will be in anti-phase and will cancel. Thus all real frequencies
actually contain equal amounts of positive and negative frequencies. These cannot be
distinguished unless a modulation process takes place. Figure 2.25(b) shows that when
two signals of frequency ±ω1 and ±ω2 , are multiplied together, the result is that the
rotations of each must be added. The result is four frequencies, ±(ω1 + ω2 ) and ±(ω1 −
ω2 ), one of which is the sum of the input frequencies and one of which is the difference
between them. These are called sidebands. Sidebands are found extensively in avionics,
where the deliberate use of the process is called heterodyning. In a communications
radio the carrier frequency is multiplied or ‘modulated’ by the audio speech signal,
called the baseband signal, and the result is a pair of sidebands above and below the
carrier.
The rotation of the helicopter rotor has a certain frequency. Any vibration due to
periodic motion affecting the movement of the blades within the rotor plane may have
a characteristic frequency with respect to the rotor. When referred to the hull of the
helicopter, the frequency of the vibration may have been heterodyned by the rotor
frequency and the frequencies experienced in the hull may then be the frequencies of
the sidebands. This will be considered in Chapters 3 and 4.
In a voice radio system, the carrier frequency is much higher than the frequencies in
the speech, whereas in other systems this may not be the case. In digital systems, continuous signals are represented by periodic measurements, or samples, and sidebands are
found above and below the frequency of the sampling clock Fs . Figure 2.26(a) shows
the spectrum of a sampling clock which contains harmonics because it is a pulse train
not a sinusoid. Figure 2.26(b) shows that the sidebands of the sampling frequency can
be rejected using a low-pass ﬁlter which allows through only the original baseband
signal. The sampled representation of the signal is returned to a continuous waveform.
This is exactly what happens in a Compact Disc player.
As the baseband frequency rises, the lower sideband frequency must fall. However,
this can only continue until the base bandwidth is half the sampling rate. This is known
as the Nyquist frequency and it represents the highest baseband frequency at which
the original signal can be recovered by a low-pass ﬁlter.

46 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 2.27 In (a) the sampling is adequate to reconstruct the original signal. In (b) the sampling rate is
inadequate, and reconstruction produces the wrong waveform (dashed). Aliasing has taken place.

Figure 2.26(c) shows what happens if the base bandwidth increases beyond the
Nyquist frequency. The lower sideband now overlaps the baseband signal. As a
result, the output frequency appears to fall as the input frequency rises. This is the
phenomenon of aliasing. Figure 2.27 shows aliasing in the time domain. The waveform
carried in the envelope of the samples is not the original, but has a lower frequency.
There is an interesting result when the two frequencies are identical. The lower sideband frequency becomes zero. This forms the basis of Fourier analysis seen in the next
section. It is also exactly what happens when a stroboscope is used, perhaps to check
the tracking of a helicopter rotor. The frequency of the ﬂashing light (the sampling rate)
is adjusted until it is the same as the rotational frequency of the object to be studied.
The lower sideband frequency becomes zero and the object appears stationary. The
upper sideband frequency is usually visible as ﬂicker.
Small variations in the frequency of the strobe light above and below the rotational
frequency will cause the rotating object to turn slowly forwards or backwards. The forward rotation is due to the lower sideband having a low frequency. However, when
the strobe frequency is above the rotational frequency, the lower sideband frequency
becomes negative, hence the illusion of reversed rotation. On a spectrum analyser, the
negative frequency would fold about zero Hz to become a positive frequency. This folding phenomenon is particularly important to an understanding of ground resonance
that will be considered in Chapter 4.

2.14 Fourier analysis
Fourier was a French mathematician who discovered that all periodic or repetitive
phenomena, however complex, could be described as the sum of a number of sinusoidal
phenomena. As the rotation of a helicopter rotor is periodic, then Fourier analysis is a
useful tool to study rotor motion.
It was shown above that the sine wave is the waveform of a single frequency. Musically
such a waveform would be called a pure tone or fundamental and the frequency would
determine the pitch. If musical instruments only produced pure tones they would be
hard to tell apart. They sound different partly because of the presence of harmonics.
Harmonics are frequencies given by multiplying the frequency of the fundamental by a
series of whole numbers. Figure 2.28 shows the waveforms of such harmonics. The ﬁnal
waveform is the sum of all of the harmonics. The relative amplitude of the different
harmonics determines the tonality or timbre of an instrument. What Fourier did was
to show how to measure the amplitude of each harmonic in any periodic waveform.
The mathematical process that does this is called a transform. Reversing the process

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 46 — #25

Technical background 47

Fig. 2.28 Fourier analysis allows the synthesis of any waveform by the addition of discrete frequencies of
appropriate amplitude and phase.

by creating all of the right harmonics and adding them is called an inverse transform.
Figure 2.29 shows how a square wave can be synthesized in this way by adding together
different harmonics of the correct amplitude and phase.
Fourier analysis is based on multiplying the waveform to be analysed by sine waves
called ‘basis functions’. In order to analyse an arbitrary waveform to see if it contains
a particular frequency, it is multiplied by a basis function at that frequency and the
product is averaged. Figure 2.30(a) shows that if the signal being analysed contains a
component having the same frequency as that of the basis function the product will have
a zero frequency component that will give a ﬁnite result after averaging. The value of
the result after averaging is called a coefﬁcient. Components at all other frequencies will
average to zero. Thus a complete Fourier analysis requires the process to be repeated
at all of the frequencies of interest.
Figure 2.30(c) shows that if by chance the input and the basis function have a phase
difference of 90◦ the product will be zero even though the frequencies are identical.

fundamental wave in degrees; 1, ﬁrst harmonic (fundamental); 2 odd harmonics 3–15; 3, sum of harmonics 1–15;
4, ideal square wave.

To overcome this problem the Fourier analysis searches for each frequency using both
a sine wave and a cosine wave basis function. Thus at each frequency two coefﬁcients
will be obtained. The ratio of the two coefﬁcients can be used to determine the phase
of the frequency component concerned.
The full frequency accuracy of the Fourier transform is only obtained if the averaging
process is performed over a very long, ideally inﬁnite, time. In practice this may cause
difﬁculties, not least with the amount of computation required, and the averaging
time may need to be reduced. If a short-term average is used, the same result will be
obtained whether the frequency is zero or very low, because a low frequency doesn’t
change very much during the averaging process. Thus the short-term Fourier transform
(STFT) allows quicker analysis at the expense of frequency accuracy. For best frequency
accuracy, the signal has to be analysed for a long time and so the exact time at which
a particular event occurs would be lost. On the other hand if the time when an event
occurs has to be known, the analysis must be over a short time only and so the frequency
analysis will be poor. In the language of transforms, this is known as the Heisenberg
inequality. Werner Heisenberg explained the wave-particle duality of light. When light
is analysed over a short time, its frequency cannot be known, but its location can.
Light can then be regarded as a particle called a photon. When light is analysed over
a long time its frequency can be established but its location is then unknown and so it
is regarded as a wave motion.
In helicopters the frequencies of interest will generally be known from the rotor speed
and usually only the ﬁrst few harmonics contribute to the aerodynamic result although
higher harmonics may result in vibration. These harmonics are normally sufﬁciently
far apart in frequency that the time span of the analysis is not critical.
One peculiarity arises with Fourier analysis of helicopter rotors. The behaviour
of a typical rotor is such that the coefﬁcients of the harmonics are always negative.

Technical background 49

Fig. 2.30 The input waveform is multiplied by the target frequency and the result is averaged or integrated.
At (a) the target frequency is present and a large integral results. With another input frequency the integral is
zero as at (b). The correct frequency will also result in a zero integral shown at (c) if it is at 90◦ to the phase of
the search frequency. This is overcome by making two searches in quadrature.

For simplicity the traditional practice has been to redeﬁne the transform so that the
numbers come out positive. This causes confusion for those who are familiar with
transforms but are studying helicopters for the ﬁrst time.

2.15 Centrifugal and Coriolis forces
Most calculations in mechanics involve a stationary frame of reference. However, as
helicopters contain some major rotating parts, designers sometimes ﬁnd it convenient
for analysis to use a rotating frame of reference turning at the same angular velocity
as the blade. The blade is then usefully more or less stationary with respect to the

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 49 — #28

50 The Art of the Helicopter
frame of reference. Figure 2.31(a) shows that when the frame of reference rotates at
the same angular velocity as the component of interest, the rotation disappears and so
that component cannot be accelerating due to the rotation. However, the centripetal
force due to the rotation is still acting and in order to maintain equilibrium with the

Fig. 2.31 (a) A rotating body is not in equilibrium. Centripetal force accelerates it into a circle. When the frame
of reference rotates at the same speed to arrest the rotation, there is no acceleration to balance centripetal
force and so a virtual force, called centrifugal force, is imagined to exist. (b) If a blade ﬂaps up its CM moves
closer to the shaft and the MoI (moment of inertia) falls. It will conserve momentum by swinging forwards. (c) In
a rotating frame of reference a blade has no momentum and a virtual force called a Coriolis force is imagined
to cause the forward swing.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 50 — #29

Technical background 51

centripetal force in the absence of acceleration, a new virtual force of equal magnitude
but opposite direction has to be imagined to act. This is called the centrifugal force. In
the real world centrifugal force does not exist, it is a mathematical convenience needed
to allow an apparent state of equilibrium in a rotating frame of reference.
In a ﬁxed frame of reference, consider a turning rotor. Figure 2.31(b) shows that if
one of the blades should move upwards, the centre of mass of the blade will move closer
to the axis of rotation, reducing the moment of inertia. Conservation of momentum
requires that the reduced moment of inertia be balanced by an increase in velocity.
Consequently the blade will accelerate in the direction of rotation as it moves up. Naval
gunners discovered a related effect which is that when a shell is ﬁred a distance of several
miles, the shell moves signiﬁcantly with respect to the earth’s axis in a rotating frame
of reference and so it will also experience conservation of momentum which takes it to
the left or right of its intended target. These are examples of the Coriolis effect, named
after the mathematician who derived the mechanics of rotating frames of reference.
Figure 2.31(c) shows that when the frame of reference rotates at the same angular
velocity as the component of interest, the rotation apparently disappears. However, the
conservation of momentum effect is still occurring and the blade appears to accelerate
with respect to the frame of reference. In order to account for this acceleration, a new
virtual force is imagined to act. This is called the Coriolis force. In the real world the
Coriolis force does not exist, like centrifugal force, it is a mathematical convenience
needed to allow the use of a rotating frame of reference.
The uninformed will often make reference to both centrifugal and Coriolis forces as
though they really existed, usually as a result of reading an advanced textbook without
understanding it. Such observations must be treated with suspicion. Centrifugal force
and Coriolis force are the technical equivalent of the unicorn and the mermaid. They
are in the imagination and the literature but they don’t exist.
There is a further consequence of the use of a rotating frame of reference that affects
vibration frequencies created in the rotor and transmitted to the hull. The frequencies
generated in the rotor may have the rotational frequency of the rotor both added and
subtracted. The phenomenon is known as heterodyning and was treated in section 2.11.

2.16 Rotating masses and precession
The rotors of a helicopter at ﬂight RPM contain a large amount of stored energy and
this alters the way they respond to forces. In order to control the helicopter, the entire
rotor has to be tilted in the direction the pilot wishes to go. This will not be achieved by
applying a couple in that direction. Figure 2.32(a) shows that if one blade is considered,
when a couple is applied to the rotor, as it rotates the couple will alternately try to move
the blade up and down. In fact in a rotating frame of reference the blade experiences a
sinusoidal forcing function at the rotational frequency of the rotor. The way in which
the blade responds to this is non-intuitive.
Figure 2.32(b) is drawn in a rotating frame of reference with respect to which the
blade is stationary and it becomes correct to refer to centrifugal force. The ﬁgure
shows that if it is assumed that the blade is displaced from its normal plane of rotation
and released, there will be a component of centrifugal force trying to return the blade
to the original plane. For small angles this force is proportional to the displacement,
so the condition for SHM is met. The blade will oscillate like a pendulum about the
normal plane at some natural frequency. This frequency can be calculated from the
mass of the blade and the centrifugal force. It turns out that the frequency is nearly
identical to the rotational frequency.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 51 — #30

52 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 2.32 (a) A couple applied in the plane of the rotor is experienced as an alternating force by each blade.
(b) In rotating co-ordinates, centrifugal force tends to return a ﬂapping blade to the ﬂat position. The restoring
force for small angle is proportional to the angle and so the blade performs SHM.

As a result when an external couple tries to tilt the plane of a rotor, the sinusoidal
force on each blade is driving the blade at its natural resonant frequency. Section 2.9
showed that at resonance the driving force is in phase with the velocity. This means
(from Figure 2.22) that the displacement lags both the velocity and the force by 90◦ of
rotation. Thus the rotor does not tilt in the direction of the applied couple, but on an axis
that is 90◦ further around the rotor in the direction of rotation. This is a fundamental
characteristic of gyroscopes and is called gyroscopic precession (invariably changed to
procession by the ill-advised use of spelling checkers). This 90◦ lag in the response of a
rotor to applied forces has a signiﬁcant bearing both on the control of the helicopter
and on how it responds to external forces. The controls have to be connected up at
right angles to the intuitive way.
As the blade tension is proportional to the square of RRPM (rotor revolutions per
minute), when the rotors are turning slowly, the acceleration experienced by the blades
due to rotation is small and the phase lag due to precession will be considerably reduced.
The helicopter cannot ﬂy at such low RRPM, but the effect may be noticed during rotor
start or shutdown in a strong wind. When the pilot tries to minimize blade sailing by
using the cyclic control, it will be found that the response is not as expected. Instead at
low speeds the blades will respond with an advance with respect to the cyclic control.
On a clockwise-from-the-top helicopter if the blades sail up on the right, the cyclic
stick will have to be moved backwards.

2.17 The gyroscope
When bodies move in a straight line, all of the body is going at the same velocity and
energy calculations are easy. However, when a body rotates, those parts furthest from
the axis are going faster than those parts near the axis. The amount of rotational energy
stored is a function of the distribution of mass with respect to the axis of rotation. This
is measured by the moment of inertia (MoI). In a ﬂywheel, as much mass as possible
is concentrated at the outside of the rotor to give the greatest MoI.
Angular momentum is the product of inertia and the rate of rotation about a given
axis. Earlier in this chapter it was seen that a body may be accelerated by changing
its speed or its direction. The same is true of a gyroscope. Changing rotational speed
is acceleration but so also is changing the direction of the rotational axis. If the rotor
is spinning rapidly it has a large momentum, and even a very small rate of movement of
the rotational axis represents a large rate of change of momentum and so a large force
is necessary. Put simply a gyroscope tends to resist disturbances to its axis in a manner
disproportionate to its weight. That makes it attractive for aviation where weight is at
a premium. The tendency to resist axis disturbance is called rigidity.
Figure 2.33(a) shows a gyroscope suspended by the shaft in a pair of nested cages
called gimbals. The axis of rotation is vertical and the gimbals allow turning in two

Fig. 2.33 (a) A vertical axis gyro supported by nested rings called gimbals. (b) A couple applied to a gimbal is
resisted by rigidity. The gyro axis turns with a 90◦ phase lag. This is called precession.

54 The Art of the Helicopter
orthogonal (at 90◦ to one another) horizontal axes. If the base of the system is pitched
and rolled, the rigidity of the gyroscope will be much greater than the friction in the
gimbals and the result is that the gyroscope axis remains vertical so that its angular
momentum stays the same. Figure 2.33(b) shows that a couple is being applied to the
outer gimbal, which tries to twist it in the direction shown. The couple is transmitted
through the bearings of the inner gimbal and to the rotor shaft. If a small element
on the periphery of the ﬂywheel is considered, this reacts in the same way as the blade
in the previous section. As the ﬂywheel is really a collection of such elements, all of
which behave in the same way, it is clear that in response to a couple on the outer
gimbal axis, the rotor responds by turning around the inner gimbal axis.
The gyroscope rotor has a 90◦ phase lag just like a helicopter rotor. The outer gimbal
will not turn because the applied couple is perfectly opposed by a reaction due to the
rigidity of the gyro. The gyro can only generate the rigidity reaction by changing its
angular momentum and to do this it must precess as the rotational speed cannot change.
The rate of precession is proportional to the applied couple and inversely proportional
to the angular momentum.

2.18 Piezo-electric and laser gyroscopes
The mechanical gyroscope held sway for a long time but has recently been supplanted by
two alternatives. A piezo-electric material is one that deﬂects when an electrical voltage
is applied to it and which creates an electrical voltage when it is distorted. The quartz
crystal in an electronic wristwatch works on the same principle. In the quartz watch
the natural mechanical resonant frequency of the crystal forms the timing reference.
Signals from sensing electrodes measure the deﬂection and are ampliﬁed and fed to
drive electrodes that cause the crystal to resonate. By dividing down this highly stable
frequency a count of seconds can be obtained.
In the piezo-electric gyroscope a vibrating element is made to oscillate as shown in
Figure 2.34(a). If the assembly then rotates, the Coriolis effect causes a component

Fig. 2.34 (a) In the piezo-electric gyro there is a vibrating beam. Rotation about an axis along the beam causes
the beam to twist as it tries to conserve momentum. This can be measured to sense the rotation. (b) In a laser
gyro, light is sent in both directions around an optical path. If the system rotates, there will be a phase change
between the two components of light.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 54 — #33

Technical background 55

of oscillation to occur at right angles to the main oscillation. Further electrodes and
suitable electronic circuits can measure the amplitude and sense of the Coriolis effect
that is proportional to the angular velocity.
A piezo-electric gyroscope may be only 20 mm long and weighs a few grams. The
power consumed is a few milliWatts. They were initially developed for image stabilizers in consumer video camcorders. These gyros have already eclipsed the mechanical
gyro in model helicopters on account of the low power and weight, and may ﬁnd certain applications in full-size machines in due course. The small size allows completely
redundant units where two or more sensors can be used in case one fails.
In the laser gyroscope, shown in Figure 2.34(b), light from a laser is split into two
components and sent in both directions round an optical path. As the distance in both
directions is the same, the two components will emerge in the same phase. However, if
the optical path rotates about the axis shown, light travelling in one direction will take
a slightly longer time and that travelling in the other direction will take a shorter time.
The two components will no longer be in phase and the phase difference is proportional
to the angular velocity. This can be sensed electronically. These alternative gyros both
have the advantage of freedom from wear.

2.19 Feedback
Control signalling conveys the desired position of a ﬂight control or a subsidiary control from one part of the airframe to another. The next essential is to ensure that when
a command is received it is carried out accurately. Feedback is a useful tool to reach
this goal. Feedback is a process that compares the current condition of a system with a
desired condition and tries to make that difference smaller. This is exactly the characteristic needed to make a remote load follow a control signal, hence the extensive use of
feedback in control systems. Feedback may be implemented in mechanical, hydraulic
and electrical systems and in the case of the latter may be implemented with analog or
digital techniques, although the principles remain the same in each case.
Figure 2.35(a) shows a basic electrical feedback servo system. The desired position
of the load is deﬁned by setting a control potentiometer that creates a proportional
electrical voltage. The actual position of the load is measured by a second potentiometer.
The actual position voltage is subtracted from the desired position voltage to create
a signal called the position error. This is a bipolar signal whose polarity indicates the
sense of the error and whose magnitude indicates how far the load is from the desired
position.
The position error is ampliﬁed and, in this example, used to power a DC electric
motor that drives the load and the feedback potentiometer. The polarity of the system
must be such that the motor runs in a direction to cancel the position error. In other
words the system has negative feedback: the information regarding the position of the
load ﬂows to the error sensor and the error information ﬂows to the load forming a
closed loop or feedback loop.
If the control potentiometer is set to a new position, a position error will result which
will drive the motor until the error becomes zero again. The power to the motor will
then be zero. In most cases this will not cause the motor to stop. The motor and the load
have inertia and once in motion may continue even if the motor power is removed. As
a result the load may overshoot the desired position. This will cause a reverse position
error so the motor is driven back. Again the load may overshoot and an indeﬁnite or
decaying oscillation known as hunting takes place.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 55 — #34

56 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 2.35 (a) A simple feedback system compares the actual load position with the desired position. To prevent
hunting, the load velocity may be measured with a tachometer (b) or by differentiating the actual position signal.

This is not acceptable in any precision system. The problem of hunting is due to
considering only the position of the load. The solution is to consider the load’s velocity
as well. In this way the control system knows how much kinetic energy is stored in
the moving load so that it can be brought to rest by applying a suitable reverse drive.
Figure 2.35(b) shows that in this example the load velocity can be measured with a
tachogenerator connected to the motor shaft. Many servo motors are designed with
an integral tachometer.
If the control potentiometer is set to a new position, the position error will drive the
motor to cancel the error. As the load gathers speed, the load velocity signal will be
subtracted from the position error. As the load approaches the desired position, the
position error becomes smaller, and when the position error is less than the velocity,
the signal driving the motor will actually reverse polarity so that the load is retarded.
This retardation process damps the hunting tendency. Instead of having a separate
tachometer the velocity of the load can be obtained by differentiating the actual position
signal.
The performance of a servo may be tested by measurement of the response to a step
input. The speed of response can never exceed the limits set by the motor power and

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 56 — #35

Technical background 57

the inertia of the system that determine the maximum slew rate. Figure 2.23 showed
the effect of different damping factors on system response. In the case of a servo the
amount of velocity feedback determines the damping factor. With little or no velocity
feedback the slew rate will be high, but hunting will be excessive and the step response
will be a decaying oscillation. With too much velocity feedback the response will have
no overshoot, but will be very slow. In between these is the condition known as critical
damping. This is deﬁned as the amount of damping which gives the fastest response
without any overshoot. The critical damping condition is simply a deﬁnable condition,
and it is not necessarily the optimum response. In most cases the response speed can
be increased signiﬁcantly with the penalty of a very small overshoot.
In an unpowered system, if the pilot experiences resistance to a control input, he will
automatically apply more force to obtain the desired control position. In a fully powered
system, the pilot (or the autopilot) does not feel this resistance and cannot compensate.
The feedback system must be designed to overcome resistance automatically. In a simple
servo, the load will stop at a position where the force from the motor is balancing the
disturbing force. Clearly in a simple feedback system, the motor can only produce a
force if there is a position error. The result is that the external force pushes the load
out of position until the position error is large enough to oppose further motion. The
ability of a servo to oppose external force in this way is called stiffness.
The stiffness of a servo can be improved by increasing the gain given to the position
error. Then a given resistance to an external force will be obtained with a smaller position error. Increasing the gain may also speed up the step response, but not beyond the
slew rate limit. If a control input exceeds the slew rate limit, for a period of time the
position error will be large and the system is not feedback controlled. In this state
the system is said to be in an open loop condition.
Clearly high gain is desirable in a servo because it increases response speed and
stiffness. However, high gain can also cause instability. During servo development, a
control input is created which is sinusoidal and the frequency is swept upwards from a
very low value. The amplitude and phase response are plotted against the frequency.
As the frequency rises, the servo has to work harder to follow the rapid movement and
so the position error may increase. This causes the load to lag the input. At some high
frequency, the phase lag may reach 180◦ .
With a 180◦ phase shift, a negative feedback system has turned into a positive feedback system. In other words the sense of the correcting action is wrong. If the loop
gain is above unity at the frequency where the phase response has gone to 180◦ , the
system will oscillate at that frequency. This may be spontaneous upon applying power
or result from a small control input. Clearly this would be catastrophic in any control
system. In practice feedback systems must contain a ﬁlter to reduce the loop gain at
high frequencies to prevent oscillation.
Another possibility that allows higher loop gain is to have a signal processor containing an inverse model of the phase characteristics of the servo loop. When the servo
loop lags, the processor will introduce a phase lead to balance out the lag. The use of
these ﬁlters and processors in a servo loop is called compensation.
If high gain cannot be used for stability reasons, it is possible to improve the accuracy
of a servo in the long term by integrating the error. Figure 2.36 shows a feedback system
with integral control. A small error at the input to the integrator will become larger
as the integrator operates until the loop acts to cancel it. Integral control is useful for
overcoming friction in mechanisms.
Feedback loops can be nested which means that one operates inside another. For
example, Figure 2.37 shows an automatic navigation system. The ﬂight director error
loop provides an error signal to the autopilot in order to keep the machine on track.

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 57 — #36

58 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 2.36 Servo error may be reduced by integration of the error. This is ideal for overcoming the effects of
static loads.

Fig. 2.37 Nested feedback loops. Here a ﬂight director compares the actual aircraft location with the desired
location to produce a navigational error. This is supplied to the autopilot that corrects the course by changing
the attitude. The autopilot’s commands are executed by feedback servos that operate the controls until the new
attitude is correct.

The autopilot loop responds by producing an attitude error that keeps the machine in
the attitude needed to hold the new track. The attitude error is supplied to the powered
control system loop that actually controls the rotors.
The advantage of nested feedback is that each loop is stabilized in its own domain.
The powered control loop is compensated to prevent oscillation or instability in the
rotor systems, the autopilot loop is compensated to prevent instability in the attitude of
the machine and the navigation loop is compensated to prevent the machine following
a serpentine track to the waypoint. A further advantage of the nested loop is that
different parts can be changed. An inertial navigator could be replaced with a GPS
navigator, for example. Also in the case of a failure, only the affected loop needs to be

“helic - CHAP02” — 2003/11/22 — page 58 — #37

Technical background 59

shut down and replaced by pilot action. For example if the autopilot failed, the pilot
could still use the outputs of the navigator and the power assistance, but he would have
to move the controls to stabilize the attitude of the machine on the course stipulated
by the ﬂight director.
Feedback loops have many advantages, but they do behave badly in the event of
certain failures. If the position feedback sensor of Figure 2.35 failed or jammed, the
movement of the load would not reduce the servo error and the servo would inadvertently keep driving the load in the direction that would normally reduce the error, until
the load reached a mechanical limit or stop. This is a characteristic of feedback loops,
which is that when they fail they generally go to one control limit. This is known as a
hardover.
Helicopters have crashed because a stability augmentation system had a hardover
failure. Subsequently systems were designed with limited authority so that even if a
hardover occurred, the amount of incorrect control travel or the force produced was
not so great that the pilot could not overcome it. The end stops of the servo could be
brought closer to the neutral position and a slipping clutch could be ﬁtted in the drive
train. Today part of the certiﬁcation process is to prove that the pilot can overpower the
servo so that control can be retained if a stability augmentation system has a hardover
failure. If this is impossible, the system will have to be made failsafe by incorporating
redundancy.
Certain helicopters use a redundant system in which the autopilot or stability augmentation signals are generated in two independent systems and fed to two motorized
servos that drive the controls through a differential gear. In the event that one of the
servos experiences a hardover failure, the tachometer of the failing system will output
an unusually large signal. Detection of the hardover condition will shut down the failing servo by removing power and apply a shaft brake to lock the motor. The remaining
servo will be able to retain control through the differential gear and the performance
will be identical if the signal which shuts down the failing servo also doubles the travel
of the surviving servo.
In a fully powered feedback servo system, the pilot simply moves a transducer and
the feedback loop will do whatever it can to carry out the command. It will still try
even if enormous resistance is met. This may result in overstressing and a solution is a
system of force feedback. The control stick is not centred by a spring, but by a force
motor. The resistance felt by the pilot comes from the force motor that produces a force
proportional to the force being exerted by the servo. In this way the pilot produces a
small force that is used to control the machine, but he also experiences a scaled down
replica of the resistance to the control efforts.
This gives the pilot a good sense of how much stress the machine is under. Force
feedback systems of this kind are also known as artiﬁcial feel systems. Artiﬁcial feel of
this kind can also be used with autopilots. If an altitude error is suddenly experienced
due to turbulence, the autopilot could react very quickly and powerfully, but to do so
would stress the airframe and cause discomfort to the passengers. It may be better to
take longer to cancel the error by reacting more gradually.
Feedback is used in servos designed for radio control of models. These work on the
principle of pulse width modulation where the length of a pulse, typically 1 millisecond
at the neutral position, is increased or reduced as a means of control signalling. A servo
operating on pulse width signalling can use feedback based on comparison of pulses.
The feedback potentiometer controls a pulse generator and the servo error is obtained
by determining the difference in pulse width between the input and the feedback pulses.
The error pulses are used directly to drive the motor ampliﬁer. As the error becomes
smaller, so does the width of the pulses, reducing the drive to the motor. Velocity may be

60 The Art of the Helicopter
sensed by measurement of motor back EMF whilst the ampliﬁer is switched off. Pulsed
ampliﬁers are electrically efﬁcient because they are either on or off and so dissipate little
heat. This is important in models where the power source will be a battery.
Although this section has considered a simple feedback system in which the controls
are signalled by analog voltages or variation of pulse width, it is possible to build
feedback systems using any type of signalling or even a mixture of types. Chapter 7
considers various methods including digital signalling.

Introduction to helicopter
dynamics

3.1 Creating and controlling lift
The basic principle of wings, rotors and airscrews is that they accelerate a mass of
air and that the resultant lift or thrust is the Newtonian reaction to that acceleration.
Producing sufﬁcient lift to permit a helicopter to ﬂy is only a matter of having enough
power to accelerate the air mass without excessive weight. A practical helicopter must,
however, be able to control that lift precisely or it would be dangerous.
Any structure placed in a ﬂow of air for the purpose of generating lift is called an
aerofoil or airfoil. Aeroplanes and helicopters can ﬂy when there is a wind blowing and
can climb or lose height in the process. In helicopters the rotor blades have airspeed
due to their rotation. Thus there can be situations where the airfoil moves through the
air, or where the air moves past the airfoil. All that matters from the point of view
of generating lift is the relative velocity and the direction from which it appears to
be approaching the airfoil. Figure 3.1(a) shows that this is known as a relative airﬂow
(RAF). RAF is a vector quantity as it has speed and direction. Figure 3.1 further shows
that a ﬂat plate will produce lift if it is slightly inclined to the RAF at an angle of attack.
When the airfoil changes the direction of air ﬂowing by, this represents a change of
velocity and so is classed as acceleration. The reaction to that acceleration will point
in the opposite direction.
Figure 3.1(b) shows how the direction of the reaction is found. For the time being,
the air is assumed to be inviscid (having no viscosity). The relative airspeed does not
change, only the direction, so the velocity vector V is changed to V  . The acceleration
to change V to V  must have been in the direction of the vector Va so the reaction must
be in the opposite direction. It can be seen that this is at right angles to the average
airﬂow direction. The blade reaction is the only actual force present. In ﬁxed-wing
aircraft studies, the reaction is traditionally resolved into two components: that which
is measured at right angles to the RAF and called the lift, and that which is measured
along the direction of the RAF and called the induced drag. In cruise lift will be vertical
and drag will be horizontal.
Figure 3.1(c) shows that the lift can be increased by increasing the angle of attack
since this has the effect of increasing the change of velocity. In the aeroplane, the
angle of attack is controlled by alteration of the attitude of the entire machine with the
elevators. In a helicopter the blades are mounted on bearings in the rotor head that

62 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 3.1 (a) Lift is the reaction to the acceleration of air into a new direction. (b) The direction of acceleration
of the air is derived as shown. The reaction must be in the opposite direction. (c) An increase in the angle of
attack increases the lift. (d) In the helicopter, lift is controlled through twisting the blade about a span-wise
axis; a mechanism called feathering.

allows them to turn about a radial axis as can be seen in Figure 3.1(d). This mechanism
is known as feathering.
When the relative velocity alone is doubled with respect to the case in (b), the vector
Va representing the change of velocity is doubled. As the air is moving twice as fast, the
wing accelerates the air in half the previous time. Achieving double the velocity in half
the time means that the reaction is increased by a factor of four. In other words, the
reaction is proportional to the square of the velocity. In practice four times as much lift
would be quite unnecessary to balance the weight of the machine and instead, as the
relative velocity doubled, the angle of attack would be reduced to about one-quarter
of the previous value. This is the mechanism by which aircraft obtain the same lift over
a range of airspeeds.

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 63

Fig. 3.2 Proﬁle drag must be included in the behaviour of any real airfoil. The induced drag and proﬁle drag
add to tilt the total blade reaction backwards. Conditions at low airspeed are shown in (a). At a higher speed,
(b), the proﬁle drag is greater, but the induced drag is less. This is only possible because it is not really a drag.

In practice the air also has viscosity that resists movement as a function of the surface
area of any body moved through it. The loss due to this effect is called proﬁle drag. The
proﬁle drag tilts the blade reaction further to the rear as in Figure 3.2(a). There is a
boundary layer between a moving object and the stationary air. At the leading edge, the
speed difference across the boundary layer is maximal and the drag is greatest. Further
back, the viscosity has been able to get the boundary layer moving and the drag is
reduced. Thus the drag experienced by a wing or rotor blade is a function not just of the
surface area but also of the chord. Very small objects possess disproportionately high
proﬁle drag, which is why the wind can blow sand but not rocks. Reynolds numbers are
used to describe the relationship between dimensions and proﬁle drag. It is important
in model testing that the airspeed used is scaled correctly. Scale speed is not used.
Instead the speed is chosen to produce the same Reynolds number in the model as in
the full-sized device and then the drag of the model will be representative.
If an airfoil is not producing lift, the induced drag will be zero and only the proﬁle
drag will be observed. In a full-size helicopter in the hover roughly 30% of the rotor
shaft power is lost to proﬁle drag, the rest goes in accelerating the air downwards. In
model helicopters and full-sized tail rotors proﬁle power is proportionately greater as
the small-chord blades operate with adverse Reynolds numbers.
Figure 3.2(b) shows the production of the same lift at a higher relative velocity.
The proﬁle drag has increased but the induced drag has reduced. This is not what
one would expect from a true source of drag. The explanation is that the airfoil is an
actuator or transducer, which accepts mechanical power as the product of the mechanical impedance and the relative velocity in order to drive the air against aerodynamic
impedance. Accelerating air downwards constantly provides lift. The actuator reﬂects
the aerodynamic impedance back as mechanical impedance. The variation in angle of
attack is analogous to changing the turns ratio of a transformer or the ratio of a gearbox. Clearly if the relative velocity goes up, to keep the power the same the impedance
must fall.
Once the concept of an airfoil as an actuator is understood, it is a small step to
appreciate that most types of actuator are reversible. Some helicopters use an electric
motor to start the engine when that motor becomes a generator. In a turbine engine, the
rotating blades in the compressor are putting energy into the air, whereas the rotating

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 63 — #3

64 The Art of the Helicopter
blades in the power turbine are taking energy out of the gas ﬂow. Given this reversibility,
we can immediately see how in a glider or in an autorotating helicopter the power ﬂow
through the actuator reverses. In descending through the air the wing or rotor delivers
power extracted from loss of potential energy and this power is used to overcome proﬁle
drag. The glider can maintain airspeed and the helicopter can maintain rotor speed
with no engine power.
The act of turning the airﬂow also results in rotational energy being imparted to the
passing air. Conceptually, the airﬂow can be divided into two ﬂows. One is the steady
ﬂow past the blade and the other is the rotational component that in the absence of
the steady ﬂow would rotate around the blade. This is known as circulation and it is
proportional to the lift. In vortex theory, the circulation of an airfoil is calculated and
the lift follows from that.
A further consequence of the change of direction is that the horizontal component
of the relative velocity is reduced. It follows from the rearward inclination of the blade
reaction that there must be a forward component of the acceleration imparted to the air.
Air does not go straight down from a hovering rotor; it also revolves in the same direction the rotor turns, but much more slowly: a phenomenon known as swirl. Swirl is
considered in section 3.14.
It is more efﬁcient gradually to accelerate the air down rather than have it suddenly
ﬁnd an inclined plate. Air passing the top edge of a ﬂat plate cannot change direction
quickly enough and the ﬂow separates and becomes turbulent. These are the reasons for
curving or cambering an airfoil. Furthermore, practical wings must contain structural
members such as spars, and the thickness will be increased to accommodate them. The
thickness is contained within a streamlined shape to reduce drag.
Figure 3.3(a) shows a streamlined cambered section. The mean camber line is half
way between the upper and lower surfaces. The chord line joins the ends of the camber
line. The angle of attack is the angle between the chord line and the relative airﬂow.
The camber of the airfoil can be optimized for the speed range of interest. For high
lift at low speeds, the camber will be heavy in order to make Va as large as possible.

Fig. 3.3 Both cambered and ﬂat airfoils will produce lift. In practice they will be thickened to reduce separation
and to allow structural components to be incorporated. Cambered airfoils work best at low speeds. In the
cambered section (a) the camber line will curve away from the straight chord line. In the symmetrical section (b)
the chord line and camber line coincide. A symmetrical airfoil is equally capable of producing lift upwards or
downwards. With zero angle of attack there is no induced drag, only proﬁle drag.

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 64 — #4

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 65

Clearly such a wing will be creating a lot of drag at the small angles of attack needed
at high speeds. For high speed operation, the camber will need to be very small, but
this kind of wing will be inefﬁcient if used at large angles of attack at low speed, hence
the use of ﬂaps on ﬁxed-wing aircraft. With a cambered section, air is still accelerated
downwards leaving the section even when the angle of attack is zero, and so a slight
negative angle of attack is necessary to obtain the zero lift condition.
Figure 3.3(b) shows a symmetrical section in which the camber line and the chord line
are one and the same. A symmetrical section is a streamlined ﬂat plate. The curvature
prevents separation over the leading edge. At zero angle of attack, the airﬂow is also
symmetrical, and no net air reaction results. There is thus no induced drag, only proﬁle
drag. If the angle of attack is made positive, air is accelerated down, and the reaction is
upwards. If the angle of attack is made negative, air is accelerated up and the reaction
is downwards.
The reader is cautioned against explanations of the origin of lift based on Bernouilli’s
theorem. Bernouilli made it quite clear that his theorem relates to conservation of
energy in ﬂowing air such that the sum of the static and dynamic pressures remains
constant. Bernouilli’s theorem only applies if no energy is put into the air. However, a
wing or a rotor blade is an actuator that is exchanging energy with the air. This is clear
from the presence of induced drag. When energy is put into the airﬂow, Bernouilli’s
theorem simply doesn’t apply and the explanations based on it are ﬂawed and should
be disregarded.

3.2 The centre of pressure
The lift developed by the blades is distributed over the chord, but not uniformly. The
centre of pressure is where a single force would act producing the same effect as the
distributed lift. In real airfoil sections, the centre of pressure is ahead of the mid-chord
point. If the blade is made of a material with uniform density, the centre of pressure
will be ahead of the centre of mass and, as Figure 3.4(a) shows, a couple results. This
couple would tend to twist the blade and increase the angle of attack, making the lift
greater and increasing the twist further. In extreme cases the blade will ﬂutter; a violent
condition that will usually destroy any structure suffering from it.
In aircraft, wings can usually be made rigid enough to prevent ﬂutter, but this cannot
be done with the long thin blades of the helicopter. The solution universally adopted is
to construct the blade so that the mass centroid (see Chapter 2) of the blade is ahead of

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 65 — #5

66 The Art of the Helicopter
the local centre of pressure. As Figure 3.4(b) shows, this results in a stable blade, since
an increase in angle of attack producing more lift tends to generate a couple reducing
the angle of attack.
The airfoil section selected for a helicopter blade will be a compromise to satisfy a
number of conﬂicting requirements. One of these is a minimal migration of the centre
of pressure over the normal range of operating conditions so that excessive feathering
couples are not fed back into the controls.
In a cambered airfoil, the centre of pressure moves fore and aft with changes in angle
of attack. The downward twist at high speed was enough to twist the blades against the
pilot’s efforts on early machines and caused some crashes. For some time, helicopters
used little or no camber in the blade section, but subsequently cambered sections
having reﬂex trailing edges were developed which reduced the centre of pressure movement. This along with the development of structures with greater torsional stiffness
allowed cambered blades to return to use, although almost invariably in conjunction
with powered controls.

3.3 The coefﬁcient of lift
Lift is equal to the rate of change of momentum induced downwards into the surrounding air. For unit airfoil area, it is proportional to the air density, the square of
the relative air velocity and, as was seen in section 3.1, it is a function of the angle
of attack. When an airfoil section is tested, the reaction is resolved into horizontal
and vertical directions with respect to RAF so that two factors of proportionality, called the coefﬁcient of lift CL and the coefﬁcient of drag CD are measured.
Figure 3.5(a) shows how these coefﬁcients change as a function of the angle of attack.
For small angles CL is proportional as it was seen in Figure 3.1(c) that the acceleration of the airﬂow is proportional to the angle through which it is deﬂected.
As the angle of attack increases the reaction rotates back and the lift component
of the reaction will be smaller than the reaction. The graph curves away from proportionality. At a large angle of attack, separation takes place, and the CL drops
sharply, accompanied by a sharp increase in CD . When this occurs the airfoil is said to
be stalled.
An airfoil does not stall immediately the angle of attack is raised, and if the rate of
angular change is sufﬁciently high the lift momentarily available might be double the
amount available in steady-state conditions. This is variously called the Warren effect
or dynamic overshoot and is shown in Figure 3.5(b). In the case of a helicopter the
angle of attack is changing at rotor speed and dynamic overshoot has a considerable
effect. In practice it means that helicopter rotors may not lose signiﬁcant amounts of
lift through stall.
In this respect the helicopter has the advantage over the ﬁxed-wing aircraft. The
latter has to be ﬂown at all times with the probability of a stall in mind. Even when
the pilot has sufﬁcient airspeed, a sudden gust due to wind shear or a microburst can
reduce that airspeed and cause a stall. It was this concern that led Juan de la Cierva to
develop the gyroplane. He correctly argued that a rotary wing aircraft that could not
stall would be safer.
The coefﬁcient of lift cannot be controlled directly; in order to obtain a certain CL
the airfoil must be set to the appropriate angle of attack. The drag is also a function of
angle of attack. It is more useful to know the ratio of lift to drag, since the peak value
of this, L/Dmax. , indicates the most efﬁcient mode in which the airfoil can be used.

Fig. 3.5 (a) How lift and drag change with angle of attack. Initially lift is almost proportional whereas drag
changes with the trend shown. As there is proﬁle drag at all angles of attack, the curve does not start from zero.
The most efﬁcient use of the airfoil will be where the L/D ratio is greatest. At steady large angles of attack the
airfoil stalls. (b) Stall does not occur instantaneously and for a short time after a large angle of attack is applied,
lift increases. With their rapidly feathering blades, helicopters can exploit this phenomenon.

For a given engine power, the greatest lift in the hover would be obtained by operating
the blades at the maximum lift over drag ratio. However, a practical helicopter cannot
operate in this condition because it would be unsafe in forward ﬂight. Many manoeuvres, such as a banked turn, require the rotor to produce a thrust which exceeds the
static weight of the machine. The ratio of thrust to static weight is called the load factor.

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 67 — #7

68 The Art of the Helicopter
A rotor hovering at L/Dmax. has a load factor of unity and would stall in any real
manoeuvre. It is thus a characteristic of helicopters that the rotor must operate below
L/Dmax. of the blade section in the hover in order to allow a reasonable load factor for
forward ﬂight.
Turning at a given rate (number of degrees per second) requires a lateral acceleration
proportional to the square of the airspeed. As aeroplanes tend to ﬂy faster than helicopters, they will need high load factors to obtain reasonable rates of turn. Aeroplanes
automatically have high load factors at speed because available lift increases as the
square of the airspeed. In helicopters lift is dominated by rotor speed, not airspeed
and so load factors in helicopters tend to be small although helicopters can still easily
out-turn most aeroplanes.
As the relative airﬂow in helicopters is dominated by the rotor speed, the gust response
of helicopters is much reduced in comparison to that of aeroplanes. This is one reason
why helicopters can operate in bad weather. A further small luxury is that the ﬂexibility
of the rotor gives in gusts a decoupling effect similar to that given by the suspension
of a car.

3.4 Collective control
In a hovering helicopter, the only source of lift is the rotor. Obtaining sufﬁcient lift is
only a matter of providing a suitable combination of power and efﬁciency, and is much
easier than controlling lift. As the lift is proportional to the square of the speed, it is
in principle possible to control lift by changing the rotor speed. Some early machines
did just that. Unfortunately, the inertia of the rotor means that speed changes cannot
rapidly be accomplished. For practical reasons a constant rotor speed is much to be
preferred.
The proportionality between the coefﬁcient of lift and the angle of attack is the
solution. As was shown in Figure 3.1, the rotor blades are mounted on feathering
bearings. Figure 1.21 showed that the pilot holds in his left hand a collective pitch
lever pivoted near the back of his seat. The lever gets its name because by lifting it,
the pitch angle of all of the rotor blades is increased by the same amount, and the
rotor lift increases immediately. This feature of the helicopter contributes enormously
to its safety. When a ﬁxed-wing aircraft ﬂies slowly, sudden loss of lift can only be
countered by raising the airspeed and this takes time. In the helicopter the airspeed is
always present due to the rotating blades and as this speed is many times higher than
any normal windspeed, the airspeed seen by the blades is always adequate.
In addition to instantaneous response to changing lift conditions, the helicopter rotor
stores in kinetic energy the equivalent of full engine power applied for several seconds.
The pilot can transiently increase the available power by using so much collective pitch
that the rotor slows down and converts its kinetic energy into lift.

3.5 In the hover
Figure 3.6(a) shows a helicopter with ﬂight RRPM, but with the collective lever lowered.
The thrust vector is small, so gravity keeps the machine ﬁrmly on the ground. If the
collective lever is raised, eventually the rotor thrust vector will exceed the weight, and
the machine will rise. By adjusting the collective lever, the machine can be made to
hover with the thrust exactly balancing the weight as in (b). If the thrust is directly

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 68 — #8

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 69

upwards, there is no resultant and the machine stays still. In the still-air hover, the
inﬂow through the rotor is axial, and if, for simplicity, it is assumed that the centre of
gravity of the machine is at the mast, the forces on the blades will not vary as they turn.
The collective control can be used to make the rotor thrust greater than or less than
the weight of the machine. The force imbalance causes the machine to accelerate up or
down. However, this acceleration does not continue indeﬁnitely. Figure 3.7(a) shows
that as the machine rises, the angle of relative airﬂow experienced by the blades is

Fig. 3.6 (a) With the collective lever lowered, the rotor thrust is less than the weight and the machine remains
on the ground. (b) With an appropriate setting of the collective lever, the rotor thrust can be made exactly equal
to the weight.

Fig. 3.7 (a) With increased collective, the machine rises, but in doing so changes the angle at which the air
approaches the blades and reduces the angle of attack. (b) With reduced collective, the opposite happens. Thus
the collective lever primarily controls vertical velocity.

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 69 — #9

70 The Art of the Helicopter
reduced by the vertical velocity. This tends to reduce the angle of attack and hence the
rotor thrust. As a result the vertical velocity reaches a value where the rotor thrust once
more balances the weight and the velocity then remains constant.
Figure 3.7(b) shows that if the collective control is lowered, the machine accelerates
downwards, but the change in relative airﬂow is such that the rotor thrust is increased.
The vertical velocity again stabilizes at a value where the thrust balances the weight.
Thus the effect of the collective control in the hover is primarily to control the vertical
velocity.
In most powered ﬂight conditions, but particularly when hovering, the rotor is working in the descending airﬂow it has itself caused. This self-inﬂicted problem is called
inﬂow. When inﬂow is present, there is a vertical component of airﬂow vectorially to
be added to the local blade velocity in order to ﬁnd the direction of the RAF.
The pilot controls the pitch angle using the collective lever and this, along with the
velocity of inﬂow through the rotor, determines the angle of attack. As a result there is
no one correct position for the collective pitch lever and the pilot will need constantly to
adapt the collective pitch setting for changes in speed, fuel burned and altitude. As there
is no correct position for the collective lever, there is no spring centring. Instead there
may be a friction mechanism that can be adjusted to hold the lever at the last position
without unduly adding to the force needed to move it. This allows the pilot to release
the lever for short periods in order to operate secondary controls.

3.6 Forces on the blades
In a helicopter having a hingeless rotor, the displacement between the area where lift is
generated and the hub where the load is applied causes upward bending stresses that
increase dramatically towards the rotor head. The underside of the blade is placed in
tension, and the upper surface is placed in compression. The rotation of the blades
produces a tension along their length that also increases towards the rotor head. The
stress caused by this tension is of the same order as the stresses due to bending, and the
stress on the underside of the blade is roughly doubled, although the compression on
the upper surface is relieved. The drag of the blades causes a rearward bending stress
that is constant in the hover.
There is a tendency for the blade rotation to force the blade to twist to a pitch angle of
zero. Figure 3.8(a) shows that when the blade is set to zero pitch, the leading and trailing
edges of the blade are further from the feathering axis than when pitch is applied. In
order to set the blades to a working pitch, some of the mass of the blade must be
brought closer to the shaft axis, and work will need to be done against the rotational
forces that will be reﬂected as a reaction seen by the control system.
The effect can be reduced by the use of so-called Chinese weights that are placed on a
rod at right angles to the chord line as shown in Figure 3.8(b). These will tend to move
away from the rotor shaft axis as a result of rotation. The term comes from the tales
told by sailors to the gullible alleging the orthogonality of certain parts of the anatomy
of the oriental female at a time long before the development of either the helicopter
or political correctness.
A less colourful alternative is to incorporate a spring into the collective linkage that is
adjusted to supply a steady force to hold the blades at a typical positive pitch, relieving
the pilot of the need to apply a constant force to the collective lever. When the blades are
not turning this spring may be powerful enough to force the blades to maximum pitch
and so the collective lever is ﬁtted with a lock that the pilot can apply prior to shutting

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 70 — #10

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 71

Fig. 3.8 (a) When the blade pitch is increased, parts of the blade are brought closer to the axis of rotation. The
blades will tend to be thrown to ﬂat pitch when the rotor is turning. (b) So-called Chinese weights are mounted
so that they oppose the effect of (a) by moving away from the axis of rotation as pitch is increased.

down the rotor. Another possibility is for the rotor head to incorporate centrifugal
weights that only apply an upload to the collective when the rotor is turning.

3.7 Rotor coning
Anyone who has examined a parked helicopter will immediately notice how droopy
the blades are. A considerable deﬂection can be obtained by lifting the tip with one
ﬁnger. How, then, can the blades lift the weight of the helicopter? The answer is that the
rapid rotation in conjunction with the mass of the blades causes them to be pulled out
straight; a phenomenon called centrifugal stiffening. Rotating blades are not in static
equilibrium and they must be made to accelerate towards the shaft if they are to follow
a circular path, and this requires a considerable inward or centripetal force, which will
always be an order of magnitude more than the weight of the helicopter.
Figure 3.9(a) shows that if the blade bends upwards, the downward component of
the centripetal force will balance the lift at some coning angle, and the resultant will be
a horizontal force only so no further bending takes place. The reaction of the blades
at the rotor head is shown in Figure 3.9(b). The force from the coning blade has an
upward component, which is the lift, and an outward component due to the rotation.
In the hover, if the blades are properly balanced and all have the same coning angle,
the horizontal forces cancel in the rotor head and only lift results. Adjusting all of the
blades to the same angle is achieved using the process of tracking which ensures that
the collective control applies exactly the same pitch to each blade. Clearly, if the blades

72 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 3.9 The blades must be accelerated inwards to make them rotate. At (a) the blades cone upwards until
the resultant of the lift and the blade tension is perfectly horizontal. At (b) the force balance at the rotor head
is shown. The tension in the upwardly coned blades cancels in the horizontal direction leaving only a vertical
component to balance the weight of the machine.

are not balanced or not tracking, vibration will result. Accurate blade balancing and
tracking is important and the necessary techniques will be considered in section 4.19.

3.8 Torque and thrust in rotors
Whilst resolving the airfoil reaction into lift and drag is useful for ﬁxed wings, it is less
useful for helicopters because of the feathering action of the blades. Figure 3.10 shows
how the reaction on a rotor blade can be resolved in a more useful fashion. As the
only real force on the airfoil is the reaction, resolving the force into components is only
taking place in our imagination, so we can resolve into whatever directions we ﬁnd
useful. In helicopters, whatever the mechanical pitch angle of the blade, and whatever
angle of attack results, it is more convenient if the reaction is resolved into the rotor
thrust acting substantially at right angles to the tip path plane or rotor disc, and the
rotor drag acting in the tip path plane.
The angle of attack is the angle by which the pitch angle exceeds the angle of the
RAF. The reaction of the airfoil is tilted further back in the presence of inﬂow, so that
a larger component of the reaction is opposing the thrust delivered by the engine, and
power is consumed simply driving against it. The rotor thrust is also slightly reduced
by the tilt of the reaction. The hover out of ground effect (HOGE) is a particularly
power consuming exercise. Inﬂow tilts back the blade reaction to oppose the engine, so
that more torque is required to drive the rotor and more tail rotor power will be needed
to balance the torque. HOGE is also one of the worst situations in which to lose power
as the high rotor drag will reduce RRPM more before the pilot reacts and lowers the
collective lever.
Clearly increasing the collective pitch will increase the induced drag, and so more
power will be required to maintain rotor speed. In simple piston engine helicopters,
the end of the collective lever is ﬁtted with a twist-grip connected to the throttle. Maintaining RRPM is then the responsibility of the pilot who will need to monitor the rev.
counter. In more sophisticated piston engine machines and in all turbine machines
automatic rotor speed governing systems or throttle correlators are used. The pilot

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 73

Fig. 3.10 The blade reaction is usefully resolved into components both in and orthogonal to the tip path plane.
These allow the rotor thrust and torque to be derived. In the presence of inﬂow, the angle of attack is the amount
by which the pitch angle exceeds the angle of the relative airﬂow.

just changes the collective pitch and the system computes the engine power for itself.
Correlators will be described in Chapter 6.

3.9 The rotor as an actuator
Without considering constructional details, it is possible to conceive of an ideal hovering rotor as an actuator disc that somehow accelerates air downwards over a circular
region and develops thrust from the reaction. In this case the operation of an ideal
rotor can be analysed theoretically from the change of momentum of the air passing
through. The concept of an ideal rotor is useful because it can act as a benchmark with
which to compare real designs. Clearly the performance of the ideal rotor can only be
approached, but never exceeded.
Figure 3.11(a) shows the actuator concept which makes some simplifying assumptions. One of these is that the air is somehow constrained to ﬂow only within the tapering
column shown, known as a stream tube, and doesn’t mix with the surrounding air. The
mass of air passing any horizontal plane in the column per unit time must be constant.
The actuator causes a pressure difference to exist across itself. This pressure must be
given by the thrust divided by the disc area. A further assumption is that this pressure
is uniform. The pressure difference across the actuator can only be sustained locally.
Figure 3.11(b) shows that at a distance, the pressure must be the same as static pressure.
To allow the pressure difference across the actuator, the pressure must have a falling
gradient along the streamlines except at the actuator itself.
Bernouilli’s theorem can be used to predict what happens along a stream tube.
Bernouilli’s theorem is simply another example of conservation of energy. Air has
a static pressure and a dynamic pressure due to its motion. Bernouilli’s theorem states
that the sum of the two, known as the head, remains constant. As a result when static
pressure falls, the dynamic pressure must increase to compensate. As the density doesn’t
change signiﬁcantly, the velocity must increase. Clearly Bernouilli’s theorem does not
hold across the actuator, as energy is put into the air there.
Except for the pressure step at the actuator, the air in the stream tube experiences a
falling pressure gradient which causes the stream to accelerate and contract. This is the
phenomenon of wake contraction seen in propellers and rotors. Thus the velocity with

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 73 — #13

74 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 3.11 (a) In actuator theory, air passes along a stream tube which is intersected by the actuator. (b) In
order to allow a step pressure difference across the rotor, pressure must fall both approaching and leaving.
Note the wake contraction to about 0.7 of the rotor diameter.

which air arrives at the actuator is higher than it is some distance before the actuator.
This difference is the induced velocity. The induced velocity is important because it
determines the velocity the rotor sees which has a large bearing on the RAF and the
power needed. It should not be confused with the ﬁnal velocity which is higher still.
In the case of an actuator that is climbing vertically, the rotor thrust is given by the
rate of change of momentum of the air passing through the disc. The power needed
must be the product of the thrust and the velocity, where the velocity is the rate of
climb plus the induced velocity. This power must be equal to the difference in the
kinetic energy well above and well below the disc. Clearly this assumption implies that
only the induced drag is being considered. Actuator theory cannot account for proﬁle
drag and assumes it to be zero.
The increased velocity applied to the downwash is twice the induced velocity at the
disc. In a stationary hover, the total velocity is the induced velocity alone and the
downstream velocity will be twice this. In practice the contraction has completed by
about one diameter below the rotor. At this point, as the velocity has doubled, the
cross-sectional area must have halved in order to have constant mass ﬂow and so the
downwash diameter will be about 0.7 of the rotor diameter.
In Figure 3.11, uniform inﬂow over the disc is assumed. In other words the induced
velocity and the pressure are the same all over. This is the most efﬁcient condition. It is
easy to show that any other condition requires more power. For a given total thrust, if
one area of the disc has greater induced velocity and thrust, another area must have less
induced velocity and thrust. The thrust is proportional to the momentum change, which
is in turn proportional to the induced velocity, whereas the kinetic energy imparted is

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 74 — #14

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 75

proportional to the square of the induced velocity. Thus the power saved in an area of
reduced thrust does not compensate for the extra power needed in an area of increased
thrust because of the square law. It follows that the minimum power is required when
the thrust per unit area is constant.
Helicopter ﬂight is dependent on a pressure difference across the rotor disc that
disturbs the air. Such pressure disturbances travel at the speed of sound and can thus
easily travel long distances from the helicopter. It should be clear that a helicopter
in ﬂight is associated with the induced movement of a signiﬁcant air mass. Such a
moving mass cannot change its velocity in an instant. Consequently a rapid change of
blade pitch does not result in an immediate change of inﬂow velocity. This will result
in an angle of attack initially higher than in the steady state and this may result in
a thrust overshoot. The same effect is observed in sailing vessels where there is a lag
between sheeting the sails and a change in sail reaction. The phenomenon is known as
dynamic inﬂow and is a macroscopic version of the dynamic overshoot phenomenon of
Figure 3.5. The inertia of the associated air mass will also have effects in translational
ﬂight as will be seen in section 3.21.

3.10 Blade element theory
The actuator concept is useful, but it does not consider a number of real world factors,
not least proﬁle drag. Blade element theory takes this into account and allows a more
accurate result to be obtained. In the hover the forward speed of some point on a blade
is proportional to the radius of that point. It is possible to analyse the performance
of a rotor by considering it to be made of small elements where the conditions over
each element are substantially constant. The overall result is obtained by adding up
the contribution from each element.
At each blade element, the inﬂow must be known so that the RAF and the effective
airspeed can be calculated. The characteristics of the blade section employed at that
element must be consulted to ﬁnd the resultant aerodynamic force on the element that
will be resolved into an element of rotor thrust and an element of drag. All of the axial
thrusts from the elements can simply be added to ﬁnd the total thrust. The drag of each
element is multiplied by the radius of the element concerned to obtain an element of
rotor torque. These elements are then added to obtain the total rotor torque.
Blade element analysis is only as accurate as the assumptions made about the inﬂow.
Actuator theory gives some idea about the inﬂow, but in a real rotor the inﬂow at the
tips and the blade roots will be non-ideal. More accurate results require the use of
vortex theory to take into consideration the conditions at the blade root and tip.

3.11 Disc loading
The thrust production mechanism in the helicopter creates a pressure difference, which
causes the air to accelerate downwards. To maintain height, the rotor then has to climb
up through the air at the same speed as the air is coming down. Work is being done
on the air and the power is the product of the weight of the helicopter and the induced
velocity. It follows that the power needed to hover can be minimized by reducing
the induced velocity. This can be achieved by reducing the disc loading. This is the
helicopter’s equivalent of span loading in a ﬁxed-wing aircraft. Where power is limited,
as in piston engine helicopters, a low disc loading will be needed to extract more lift

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 75 — #15

76 The Art of the Helicopter
from the available power. Some of that lift will be lost because the larger rotor will be
heavier.
In a turbine helicopter, the engine and fuel supply weigh less for the power the
engine produces and so a better result may be obtained by using a smaller rotor and
transmission that also weighs less to obtain a greater useful payload. A comparison of,
for example, an Enstrom F-28 and a Hughes 500 illustrates this point.
This cannot be taken to extremes, as there is a practical limit to the downwash
velocity. This is reached when objects on the ground are blown about and become
a hazard. The CH-53E Stallion represents about the limit of acceptable downwash
velocity as it is almost impossible to stand in the downwash. A further consideration
is that in autorotation a machine with a high disc loading may have a rapid rate of
descent, leaving the pilot little margin for error in judging the ﬂare-out in the case of
an engine failure. On the other hand a machine with a low disc loading may have very
good autorotation performance, the Enstrom being a particularly good glider.
Once a disc area and loading has been decided, some consideration has to be given to
the tip speed. Proﬁle power is proportional to the cube of the tip speed, whereas thrust
is proportional to the square of the tip speed. The minimum proﬁle power is where the
minimum possible tip speed is used to operate the blades at L/Dmax. , which will be just
below the stall. Reducing the tip speed will require the blade area to be increased to
maintain thrust. Consequently the disc area is chosen to give the desired disc loading,
whereas the blade area is chosen to produce sufﬁcient rotor thrust (with an adequate
load factor) at the chosen RPM. The ratio of the total blade area to the disc area is
known as the solidity. Although low tip speeds and high solidity reduce proﬁle drag
and improve hovering performance, a machine built to these criteria would not have
an adequate load factor for forward ﬂight. It will be seen in section 3.24 that a low tip
speed is also detrimental to forward ﬂight as well as being a liability in the case of a
power failure as the rotor stores little energy, giving the pilot little time to react and
establish autorotation.
In a conventional helicopter there will always be a compromise between hover and
forward ﬂight performance. Possible technical solutions include variable rotor speed
and variable diameter rotors.
In the hover a low rotor speed would reduce proﬁle drag by allowing the blades to
operate closer to L/Dmax. , whereas in cruise a high rotor speed would improve the
load factor. To obtain maximum power from a piston engine at both speeds, a twospeed transmission would be needed, and there would be some weight and cost penalty.
Changing the speed would be easy with a free turbine engine. There would also be a
problem in detuning the rotor to minimize vibration at two different speeds. These
problems are not insuperable.
A variable diameter rotor could have a low disc loading for efﬁcient hover, but a
raised disc loading in cruising ﬂight. The technical problems here are enormous but
may one day be economically viable.

3.12 Figure of merit
Whatever the disc loading, in a constant height hover, the potential and kinetic energy
of the helicopter remain constant, and so no work is being done on the helicopter. Thus
the mechanical efﬁciency of all helicopters in the hover is zero. Clearly mechanical
efﬁciency is not a useful metric, because it doesn’t allow comparison. A better metric is
to compare the power theoretically needed by an ideal actuator with the actual power

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 76 — #16

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 77

needed in the real helicopter where the actuator has the same diameter as the rotor.
This is the origin of the ﬁgure of merit.

3.13 Blade twist and taper
The forward velocity of the rotating blade increases linearly from zero at the shaft
to a maximum at the tip. This is not a good starting point from which to obtain
uniform inﬂow, but the rotor is the only practical approximation to an actuator disc that
anyone has devised. The ﬁgure of merit may be improved by twisting and tapering
the rotor blades. Figure 3.12(a) shows that in untwisted, untapered blades, the lift
will be produced increasingly toward the tips as a parabolic function, until tip loss
dominates.
Given the induced velocity is required to be uniform, it is easy to calculate the pitch
required at any radius to make the angle of attack constant along the blade so that
the whole blade operates at an efﬁcient L/D ratio. However, in practice the induced
velocity will be a function of radius and such a twist will not be optimal. Twist that
takes account of induced velocity distribution is known as ideal twist. In fact ideal
twist is academic because the amount of twist would have to change as a function of
induced velocity and clearly it does not in any practical blade.
Ideal twist does not achieve uniform inﬂow, because of the reduced effectiveness of the
inner slow-moving parts of the blade. Tapering the blade as well as twisting it removes
area at the fast moving tips and places it in the slower moving areas where induced
velocity is ordinarily lower. Ideally, the rotor chord needs to be inversely proportional
to the radius. This results in an impractical rotor for a helicopter, but the technique

Fig. 3.12 (a) An untwisted, untapered blade has a parabolic lift distribution and far from uniform inﬂow.
(b) Taper and twist improve the uniformity of inﬂow.

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 77 — #17

78 The Art of the Helicopter
will be found in axial blowers where the root chord may be several times the tip chord.
Figure 3.12(b) shows a better lift distribution resulting from a combination of twist
and taper. Blade taper has the further advantage that the various vibration modes of
the blade will not be harmonically related. This will be considered in section 3.26.
In practical helicopters the blades cannot extend all the way to the mast because
of the need to provide a rotor head mechanism. A further consideration is that, in
the hover, the extreme roots of the blades simply provide a downwash onto the hull
resulting in a download, negating some of the rotor lift. Section 3.20 will show that,
in forward ﬂight, the blade root of the retreating blade encounters reverse airﬂow. As
a result blades often have a signiﬁcant root cut. Ideal twist for hovering will not be
ideal for forward ﬂight or autorotation and a compromise is invariably necessary. In
the proprotors of a tilt-rotor helicopter more twist will be possible because the rotors
work with predominantly axial ﬂow.

3.14 Swirl
In a real rotor, the downwash does not just move downwards, but it also has a rotational
component of motion known as swirl. Intuitively it is clear that the turning rotor must
turn the air with it to some extent. Figure 3.10 showed that the reaction on a lifting blade
is somewhat aft of the rotor shaft axis. It must follow that the direction in which the
momentum of the inﬂow increases is in the opposite direction. The vertical component
is the inﬂow velocity, which produces lift, whereas the horizontal component creates
swirl which represents wasted power.
Some of the swirl is due to proﬁle drag and some is due to induced drag. In the absence
of proﬁle drag, the blade reaction is still slightly behind the vertical and this must result
in a small loss when compared with an ideal actuator that only causes vertical inﬂow.
The main source of swirl is the result of proﬁle drag adding to the rotational momentum
of the air. In an ideal actuator the air leaves with increased vertical momentum only. In
a real rotor the amount of swirl gives an indication of the ﬁgure of merit. The higher
this is, the lower the swirl will be. In a twisted blade, swirl will be greatest near the root
where the pitch angle is greater.
The torque delivered to the rotor shaft can be divided into two parts, ﬁrst the torque
needed to drive an ideal rotor which only produces an increase in vertical momentum
sufﬁcient to create the required thrust, and second an additional torque which is the
reaction to creating swirl and tip vortices. With a single rotor, swirl energy is lost forever,
but in contra-rotating rotors, the swirl of the second rotor can cancel the swirl of the
ﬁrst. Unfortunately this does not reduce proﬁle drag, it only reduces induced drag.
In the single rotor helicopter, the main effect of swirl is that the downwash on the hull
is not vertical, which adds to the general air of asymmetry surrounding the helicopter.
The effects will be considered in Chapter 5.

3.15 Vertical autorotation
The direction of the reaction on an airfoil depends upon the angle of attack. When
hovering, inﬂow causes the resultant to be tilted back and opposes the engine thrust.
If, at a suitable height the collective pitch is lowered, the machine starts to fall, the
inﬂow reverses and the relative airﬂow has an upward component. Figure 3.13(a) shows
that the principle of the rotor blade in autorotation is no different to powered ﬂight.
It continues to accelerate air into a new direction. However, as the air approaches

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 78 — #18

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 79

Fig. 3.13 In autorotation, inﬂow is reversed. Air approaches from below so that the reaction has a forward
component. (a) Middle part of blade is driving, taking momentum from the air. These conditions can be obtained
with positive blade pitch. (b) Outer part of blade has a lower angle of attack and is being driven as in normal

and so the wake is slower than the approaching air and expands. This should be compared with Figure 3.11.

80 The Art of the Helicopter
upwards, the acceleration has a rearward component. The reaction to this is forward,
so the rotor can be driven against proﬁle drag and transmission losses. At a suitable
setting of the collective pitch, the overall reaction on the blades is brought to the vertical
and so they will continue to turn at the same speed and provide lift. Note that in order
to produce lift the blade must have a positive angle of attack with respect to RAF and
so it is common for the blade to have positive pitch in autorotation.
The machine is moving steadily downwards using potential energy to overcome proﬁle drag. In fact the rotor is taking momentum from the air so that induced power
becomes negative and provides the proﬁle power needed. The strict deﬁnition of autorotation is the requirement for zero shaft torque. Where a rotor actually delivers shaft
power it is said to be windmilling or in the windmill brake state. A real helicopter
in autorotation is technically windmilling because the shaft torque is not zero. In the
absence of the engine, some shaft torque is needed to turn the tail rotor and any other
important items such as hydraulic pumps.
The speed of a blade element is proportional to radius. A further complication is that
most rotor blades have twist to improve the hover ﬁgure of merit, but in autorotation
the inﬂow is reversed and the twist is the opposite of what is needed. It can be seen
that on moving from tip to hub, the RAF decreases in speed but the angle of attack
increases. As a result the central part of the blade, shown at Figure 3.13(a) is being
driven by the inﬂow and is windmilling. Figure 3.13(b) shows that the tips have a small
angle of attack and high airspeed. Proﬁle drag dominates and L/D is poor, with the
total blade reaction being behind the vertical. This area of the blade is producing lift
and induced drag as if it was in the power-on condition. Figure 3.13(c) shows that
the innermost parts of the blades are stalled as they have a high angle of attack and
a low airspeed. The power needed to drive the tips and the inner parts of the blade
comes from the windmilling of the centre parts. Only a small section of each blade at
the boundary between the driven and driving regions is technically autorotating with
a vertical total blade reaction. Thus what is meant in practice by autorotation is that
the entire rotor has zero net torque. The entire rotor can also be considered to have an
L/D ratio and in autorotation the slowest rate of descent will be where this is used.
In practice the loss of performance in autorotation due to twisted blades is surprisingly small. One reason for this is that the proﬁle drag is determined only by the rotor
speed and is largely unaffected by local angle of attack. Another is that real blades
don’t have anything like ideal taper and also have root cut-out so the stalled inner part
of the rotor doesn’t absorb as much power as might be expected.
In autorotation there is still a pressure step across the rotor, but the inﬂow is now
from below. Figure 3.13(d) shows that as the rotor is taking momentum from the air,
the slipstream from the rotor is slower than the inﬂow. The pressure gradient along a
streamline is rising and so the wake expands.
In autorotation the best rate of descent will be where the entire rotor (not a blade
section) operates at L/Dmax. . The highest RRPM will also be obtained at L/Dmax. , giving the greatest stored energy for landing. Figure 3.14 shows an autorotation diagram
in which the vertical axis is drag over lift and the horizontal axis is angle of attack α.
It will be seen from the ﬁgure that, at an idealized blade radius, the ratio of drag to lift
determines the angle ϕ which must also be the angle of RAF if the blade reaction is to be
vertical. If the pitch angle is θ , then ϕ = α −θ. The function α −θ is shown on the graph
to be a straight sloping line. The lowest proﬁle drag will be at the bottom of the drag
‘bucket’ and the pitch angle to achieve that is where the line of α −θ intersects the α axis.
Most conventional helicopters will be rigged so that the minimum pitch stop on the
collective lever is at about this value. Thus operation in autorotation is in the region to
the right of the intersection, but not so far as the position of the dotted line where rotor

Fig. 3.14 In ideal autorotation, the total blade reaction must be vertical as shown. For a given pitch angle θ,
the rotor operates at the intersection of the α − θ line with the drag bucket. See text.

speed may be irrevocably lost. In this region rotor speed may be changed by alteration
of the balance of forces. Reducing the angle of attack causes the blade reaction to move
forward from the vertical. Negative induced power exceeds the proﬁle power requirement until the rotor speed has increased. On the other hand, increasing the angle of
attack causes the reaction to move behind the vertical, and the rotor speed falls.

3.16 Tip loss and the vortex ring
The pressure differential between the upper and lower surface of the rotor disc causes
air to try to ﬂow transversely around the tip in order to equalize the pressure. This
rotary ﬂow combines with the blade velocity to leave a corkscrew-like trail shown in
Figure 3.15(a) and known as a vortex. The loss of pressure differential due to this vortex
generation cancels out the lift generated at the blade tip; an effect known as tip loss.
Nearly 10% of the blade length is useless. The power needed to overcome induced drag
at the tip is wasted generating the vortex. There must also be a vortex at the inboard end
of the blade but it is less powerful because the lift gradient is much lower. In the steady
hover and in forward ﬂight, the tip vortices are swept away downwards by inﬂow.

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 81 — #21

82 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 3.15 (a) The pressure difference across the blade due to the generation of lift results in a ﬂow from
bottom to top around the tip that results in a spiral vortex. (b) In the hover the tip vortices are swept away
downwards, but not as fast as the inﬂow which is generally faster towards the tip.

Tip loss may be reduced by tapering and by twisting the blade near the tip so that
the angle of attack is small. The pressure differential is then minimized across the tip.
This cannot be taken too far as very small tip chords will operate at poor Reynolds
numbers and suffer poor L/D. As a practical matter space will also be needed for tip
weights.
It will be seen in Figure 3.15(b) that the result of non-uniform inﬂow is that the air
disturbed by the passage of the blades changes from a disc to a cone and shrinks in
diameter due to wake contraction.
In autorotation the vortices are swept away upwards. Thus in climb, hover or autorotation the vortices are always carried off by the slipstream. However, if a vertical powered descent is attempted, the machine descends into its own inﬂow and the vortices
from successive blade sweeps are closer together and begin to reinforce one another.
As the vertical rate of descent approaches the induced velocity, the vortices will not be
swept away so much, and will begin to augment one another. The airﬂow will recirculate, in a toroidal motion known as a vortex ring. This is shown in Figure 3.16. The
recirculation is increasing the inﬂow and so more collective pitch is needed to provide
the same lift. The blade reaction will tilt back and more torque will be needed.
Paradoxically, a helicopter needs more power to descend in the hover than it does
to maintain height. Early helicopters having marginal power used low disc loading

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 83

Fig. 3.16 When the helicopter descends vertically, it can catch up with its own wake and the rotor vortices
are not swept away, but result in recirculation. If allowed to develop fully, the result is the vortex ring condition.

normalized with respect to induced velocity in the hover. Note there is a discontinuity between powered
descent and autorotation due to the vortex ring condition.

and so had low induced velocity. Some suffered from power settling where above a
certain rate of vertical descent the descent could not be arrested except by moving into
forward ﬂight.
Figure 3.17 shows the relationship between the induced velocity needed and the
climb/descent velocity. As the effects are proportional to the hover induced velocity,
Figure 3.17 has been normalized by dividing both parameters by that factor. As a
result the curve passes through unity in the stationary hover. Note that as the rate of
descent increases, following the curve to the left, there is a discontinuity where a fully
developed vortex ring condition occurs. The recirculation has now enveloped the rotor
whose ability to produce lift is considerably reduced. The effectiveness of the cyclic
pitch will also be reduced. Increasing collective makes it worse. The machine drops like
a stone, pitching and rolling randomly. If this condition is entered close to the ground,
recovery may be impossible.
To create lift a rotor must have mass ﬂow whose momentum it can increase. In hover
or climb, the inﬂow is downward and the rotor puts momentum into the inﬂow by
accelerating it. In a vertical autorotation the inﬂow is upward (effectively making the
momentum negative) and the rotor puts momentum into the air by slowing it down.
Both of these conditions are stable and the results are predictable from actuator disc

84 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 3.18 Avoiding the vortex ring. Autorotation is entered in forward ﬂight, and then the forward speed is
brought to zero. Prior to resuming powered ﬂight, forward speed must be regained.

theory. The problem is that in vertical ﬂight to get from downward inﬂow to upward
inﬂow the state of zero inﬂow must be traversed.
Zero inﬂow makes nonsense of actuator disc theory, and the real helicopter can’t
ﬂy in that condition either, hence the discontinuity in the curve of Figure 3.17. The
position of the discontinuity is affected by blade twist. A twisted blade produces more
thrust at the inner parts of the disc and excites the vortex ring less, so it is possible to
descend faster.
It must be accepted that there are certain combinations of vertical rate of descent and
induced velocity in which a helicopter will be uncontrollable. Thus an important part
of pilot training is to impart a practical knowledge of how to ﬂy outside that region,
how to recognize the onset of a vortex ring and how to recover from it.
Using forward speed to guarantee an inﬂow allows the vortex ring condition to be
avoided. Figure 3.18 shows that to enter autorotation from forward ﬂight the collective
is simply lowered until the inﬂow reverses. Once in autorotation the forward speed can
be brought to zero for a vertical descent. In order to terminate the vertical autorotation forward speed is regained before raising collective pitch again to obtain normal
downward inﬂow.

3.17 Ground effect
When hovering close to the ground, the air passing downward through the rotor cannot
escape as freely as shown in Figure 3.19(a). Air pressure below the machine builds up,
and reduces the induced velocity. The RAF is closer to the horizontal and the blade
resultant is closer to the vertical. The same lift can be obtained from the rotor with less
rotor drag. As Figure 3.19(b) shows, considerably less power is needed to hover close to
the ground. As the ﬁgure shows, ground effect is noticeable up to a height approximately
equal to the rotor radius. In still air, a helicopter will reach equilibrium in ground effect
at a height where the lift just balances the weight without any input to the collective pitch

control. If the machine descends, it will obtain more lift from the air cushion; if it climbs,
the lift will fall. In many respects the helicopter in ground effect is like a hovercraft.
A helicopter in ground effect over water will displace some of its weight in a saucershaped depression in the water surface. This is not often seen because hovering low
over water is a recipe for spray in the engines.
The presence of the rotor head and blade root cut-out creates a hole in the middle
of the disc through which air can escape upwards in ground effect. This is actually
another form of tip loss, which is called the fountain effect. In practice the fountain
effect can be beneﬁcial because it puts some of the hull into upﬂow and reduces the
hull download. There will be vortices trailing from the inboard end of the blade. As
the lift gradient is small here these are relatively weak and their main contribution is
that in ground effect they make the hover conditions chaotic especially if they interact
with the tail boom or tail rotor.
It is often stated by pilots that hovering over rough ground ‘dissipates’ the ground
effect, when theory would suggest that restricting the ability of the downwash to escape
would enhance ground effect. This aerodynamic effect ought to be very small, and the
real effect may be psychological. When hovering over a crop, the pilot will estimate his
height from the top of the crop, not from ground level. Thus the ground effect may not
appear as powerful.

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 85 — #25

86 The Art of the Helicopter
Ground effect normally increases lift so that it offsets the effect of vortex ring generation. The two effects are always opposing one another. However, hovering close to a
wall or next to another helicopter can trigger recirculation (Figure 3.19(c)).

3.18 Cyclic control
In order to move around in the hover, the pilot pushes the cyclic stick in the direction
he wants to go. This superimposes a cyclic variation of blade pitch on the average or
collective setting. The result is that the blades oscillate sinusoidally about the feathering
axis as shown in Figure 3.20(a) at the same frequency as the rotor turns. As a result
the lift will increase on one side of the rotor and decrease on the other, resulting in a

Fig. 3.20 (a) The cyclic control causes the pitch of the blades to change sinusoidally at the rotor frequency.
The rotor disc will tilt with a 90◦ phase lag. (b) Tilting the disc has the effect of reducing the vertical component
of rotor thrust. In practice a slight increase in collective is required to maintain height as the cyclic control is
used to move off.

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 86 — #26

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 87

rolling couple. As was seen in Chapter 2, the rotor is gyroscopic and so the cyclic pitch
change is arranged to occur 90◦ ahead of the required result to allow for precession in
the rotor.
Figure 3.20(b) shows that the application of cyclic control tilts the thrust vector,
and that there will be a resultant of the thrust vector and gravity which is primarily
horizontal but also has a slightly downward component. This is because the vertical
component of the rotor thrust becomes smaller when the disc is tilted. As a result the
helicopter will accelerate sideways and lose height. To compensate, the pilot slightly
raises the collective lever so that the vertical component of the thrust remains the same.

3.19 Basic manoeuvres
From the hover, the helicopter can be accelerated into translational ﬂight by using
cyclic pitch to tilt the disc. The greater the acceleration required, the more extreme will
be the disc tilt and the greater the application of collective pitch. Figure 3.21(a) shows
a helicopter at maximum horizontal acceleration. If done at low height, the blades can
get very near the ground. Figure 3.21(b) shows that at constant speed and height the
thrust necessary to balance the drag of the pure helicopter comes from the horizontal
component of the inclined rotor thrust. The vertical component of the rotor thrust must
balance the weight of the machine. Clearly the rotor thrust must be greater than in the
hovering condition. The diagram simpliﬁes the situation in that it assumes the drag of
the fuselage acts at the rotor hub, which is not actually the case. In practice the drag
acts below the hub to produce a couple which would depress the nose. There are two
ways of dealing with that: using a rotor head which can apply an opposing couple from
the blades and/or using a tail plane to produce a down thrust.
Note that the tip path plane may be inclined forwards with respect to the hull so that
the balance of forces is obtained with the hull level. In this condition the drag will be
minimized and the occupants will be most comfortable. A consequence is that when
the machine comes to the hover it will sit with a tail down attitude. The length of the
undercarriage legs or the angle of the skids is often arranged such that the machine can
settle on the ground very nearly in this attitude.
Tilting the disc accelerates the machine along, but bringing the disc back to the
horizontal only removes the acceleration, and the machine will continue along, slowing
only because of drag. In order to stop, the disc must be tilted the opposite way to
obtain acceleration in the opposite sense to reduce the velocity. Figure 3.21(c) shows
a helicopter with maximum deceleration in a manoeuvre known as a quickstop. Note
that the inﬂow has reversed so that a quickstop is actually a form of autorotation. Note
that the tail boom is very low, and could strike the ground.
Figure 3.21(d) shows a turn at speed. The turn changes the direction but not the
speed, so it is a change of velocity or acceleration. The acceleration must be towards
the centre of the turn, and it is necessary to obtain a resultant sideways force to cause
that acceleration. This is done by banking with lateral movement of the cyclic stick.
Collective will need to be increased to maintain the vertical component of thrust equal
to the weight. The machine will then ﬂy around as if on the surface of a cone until
the desired heading is reached, when the bank will be taken off and the collective
reduced again. Note that in a 60◦ bank the thrust vector has to be twice that needed
to hover in order to maintain height. The ratio of manoeuvre thrust to hover thrust
is called the load factor. Not all machines can deliver that much power, and not all
transmissions can accept it. However, some large transport helicopters can carry their

own weight in cargo. When unladen, their load factor effectively doubles and they can
safely accomplish some quite alarming manoeuvres.
Note that during acceleration, deceleration and a correctly banked turn gravity still
appears to act vertically down through the cockpit ﬂoor, and it is possible to complete
an entire ﬂight without spilling a mug of coffee placed on the ﬂoor.

3.20 In translational ﬂight
In translational ﬂight, the forward velocity increases the velocity of the air passing
the advancing blade and reduces that seen by the retreating blade. Figure 3.22 shows
what happens. In (a) it can be seen that the velocity of a blade element due to rotation

is given by the distance D from the shaft multiplied by the angular speed ω. When
the blade is at 270◦ , the edge of the reverse ﬂow region will be where ωD equals the
airspeed V . In (b) the method for ﬁnding what happens at an arbitrary blade angle is
shown. At any distance d from the shaft, the vector resultant R of ωd and V can be
found. Figure 3.22(c) shows the derivation of the expression for d, the distance from the

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 89 — #29

90 The Art of the Helicopter
shaft to the boundary of the reverse ﬂow region. Figure 3.22(d) shows the expression
for d graphically and it will be seen that the reverse ﬂow area is circular and that its
diameter increases with speed. Instantaneously the rotor is turning with respect to the
outer edge of the reverse ﬂow region. The ratio of forward speed to tip speed is known
as the advance ratio µ which is the same as the ratio of the diameter of the reverse ﬂow
region to the blade radius.
The retreating blade suffers reverse ﬂow near the root; a small downward force may
be experienced because the retreating blade effectively has a negative angle of attack
due to ﬂow reversal. Here is another reason for root cut-out, to reduce the amount of
useless reverse-ﬂowed blade. However, as the area is proportional to the square of the
diameter, the amount of disc area lost to the reverse ﬂow region is small. For example,
at µ = 0.4, the diameter of the reverse ﬂow region is 0.2 of the rotor diameter but the
area lost is only 4%.
Owing to the huge difference between the airspeeds, if nothing were done, the advancing blade would produce more lift and the retreating blade less. This would apply to
the rotor a roll couple toward the retreating side. The gyroscopic action of the rotor
would result in a response delayed by 90◦ of rotation corresponding to a rearward pitch
effect. This rearward couple is colloquially known as ‘ﬂapback’ and it tends to reduce
the forward tilt of the machine and consequently reduces the forward component of
the rotor thrust, slowing the machine down.
Thus sustained forward ﬂight requires a continuous application of forward cyclic
control that reduces the angle of attack of the advancing blade and increases that of
the retreating blade in order to balance the lift moments on the two sides of the rotor.
In cruise the amount of cyclic pitch applied may be of the order of 5◦ . Flapback results
in speed stability because it automatically opposes the cyclic control.
The more forward cyclic is applied, the higher will be the forward speed. Thus in
translational ﬂight the fore-and-aft position of the cyclic stick primarily controls the
airspeed. If the airspeed is changed, the collective lever will need to be adjusted to
maintain height because tilting the rotor thrust vector alters its vertical component.
In forward ﬂight the rotor has access to a greater mass of air. Thus the same momentum increase and the same thrust can be obtained with a smaller induced velocity and
this reduces the power needed. Figure 3.23 shows that there is a minimum induced
power speed where the inﬂow velocity is the least.

3.21 Inﬂow and coning roll
In ﬂight, there is a region of low pressure above the rotor and a region of high pressure
below. This pressure difference results in a tendency for air in the plane of the rotor
to move upwards. Figure 3.24(a) shows that this happens for some distance from the
edge of the disc. Simple inertia keeps the air moving upwards so that in translational
ﬂight, the leading edge of the disc encounters upwash. The upwash ceases when the
downward impulse of the rotor cancels the upward momentum of the air mass.
In slow forward ﬂight, Figure 3.24(b), the low pressure above the rotor has time to
bend the inﬂow increasingly downwards as it reaches the trailing edge of the disc. The
disc can be thought of as a low aspect ratio wing producing tip vortices which roll
inward at the top and down through the rear of the disc. The result is a reduction of
the angle of attack of the blade at the rear of the disc compared to that at the front.
The loss of lift at the rear of the disc is subject to the phase lag, or precession, of the
rotor and manifests itself as a roll to the advancing side, which is known as inﬂow roll.

(c)

Fig. 3.24 (a) Given the pressure difference across a rotor in the hover, surrounding air will tend to move
upwards. In translational ﬂight the edge of the rotor may actually encounter upwash. (b) In forward ﬂight the
rotor acts like a low aspect ratio wing. Vortices curl over the tips and down through the rear of the disc, reducing
the angle of attack there. Loss of lift at the rear precesses into inﬂow roll. (c) As the rotor blades are coned, in
forward ﬂight the air approaches at a different angle as shown here. The component perpendicular to the blade
is greater for blades at the rear, where the angle of attack is reduced.

Whilst coning causes no undue aerodynamic problems to a hovering helicopter, it
has an unwanted effect in forward ﬂight. Figure 3.24(c) shows that the effect of coning
is to reduce the angle of attack of the blade passing across the tail compared with
that of the blade passing across the nose. As for the inﬂow roll, this results in a taildown moment applied to the disc, which likewise manifests itself as a roll towards the
advancing side because of the phase lag of the rotor. The two effects take place in
parallel, but as different functions of airspeed. Inﬂow roll commences on leaving the
hover but reduces signiﬁcantly as speed increases, whereas coning roll slightly increases

has less effect as speed rises, whereas coning roll increases with speed as the coning angle may increase to
produce more thrust.

with airspeed. Figure 3.25 shows how the lateral cyclic control might have to be moved
to the retreating side in order to ﬂy straight at different airspeeds.
Thus in straight ﬂight at constant speed, the cyclic stick must be held slightly towards
the retreating side to counteract the inﬂow and coning induced rolls as well as forwards
to counter the advancing/retreating induced pitch-up. In some machines the phasing of
the controls is arranged so that forward cyclic automatically creates a degree of lateral
cyclic. However, in the hover this results in the machine not responding precisely in the
direction the stick is pushed.
Like the collective control, there is no one correct setting for the cyclic control. The
cyclic trim control is used to shift the neutral position of the stick, relieving the pilot
of the need to produce continuous control forces.

3.22 Rotor H-force
The retreating blade has the airspeed subtracted from the rotational speed and so has
to operate with an increased angle of attack. The proﬁle drag will be reduced but
the induced drag will increase. Conversely the advancing blade will suffer signiﬁcantly
more proﬁle drag because of the high relative airspeed, but the induced drag will fall
because the angle of attack has been reduced. The overall effect of proﬁle drag and
induced drag does not balance between the advancing and retreating sides and the
resultant is a rearward acting force called the H-force. Figure 3.26 shows that the
H-force is the reason why the rotor thrust is not precisely at right angles to the tip path
plane. A typical ﬁgure is 1◦ .
Because of inﬂow and coning, the blades crossing the nose produce more lift than
the blades crossing the tail and so the induced drag is not the same. The resultant is the
Y-force which acts at right angles to the direction of ﬂight. The H-force is small and
the Y-force is very small with the result that the effect on the magnitude of the thrust
is insigniﬁcant.

3.23 Blade stall and compressibility
Stall occurs when air passing over the cambered upper surface of a blade can no longer
accelerate rapidly enough to follow the surface. Airﬂow breaks away and lift is lost

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 93 — #33

94 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 3.26 H-force and Y-force. Conditions experienced by the blades in forward ﬂight are asymmetrical and
this reﬂects as cyclic differences in blade drag that produce a force in the plane of the rotor. The rotor thrust
is not precisely at right angles to the tip path plane because of this force. H- and Y-forces are the components
of this force in the fore-and-aft and transverse directions. The effect is very small and not really noticeable to
the pilot.

accompanied by an increase in drag. As acceleration is the limiting factor, at low
relative velocities air can negotiate the blade at a larger angle of attack than at high
velocity. Figure 3.27(a) shows the stall limit diagram for a typical section. As the speed
of sound is approached, the allowable angle of attack becomes very small. Note that the
speed of sound falls with falling temperature and in very low temperature conditions
helicopters with high tip speed will suffer a performance loss.
In fast translational ﬂight, the tips of the rotor blades will be encountering relative
airﬂow that alternately adds to and subtracts from the rotational speed. The pitch
angle will change sinusoidally owing to the use of cyclic feathering but the angle of
attack follows a more complex function owing to the effects of coning and inﬂow.
Figure 3.27(b) shows the angle of attack of a part of the blade near the tip plotted
against the relative airﬂow velocity. It will be seen that the plot is an elongated ﬁgure
of eight. At positions A and C the blade movement is transverse, whereas at B and D
the forward speed is subtracted from or added to the rotational velocity.
When the plot is superimposed on the stall limits of the airfoil section, it becomes
possible to predict where blade stall will occur. This has been done in Figure 3.28.
Figure 3.28(a) shows the conditions near the maximum airspeed. (b) shows that with
a heavily loaded machine, stall can occur on the retreating blade where it has very low
relative speed. The retreating blade needs to be feathered to a large angle of attack to
resist lift asymmetry and inﬂow roll. The peak angle of attack will be reached at about
285◦ and the length of stalled blade will be greatest here. The loss of lift around 285◦ is
converted by rotor phase lag to a pitch-up and roll. An attempt to correct the roll with
cyclic will accentuate the stall and loss of control will result. Figure 3.28(c) shows that
with a lightly loaded machine in straight and level ﬂight or in a dive, advancing blade
compressibility stall will occur ﬁrst at high forward speed.
Partial blade stall can also be provoked at moderate speeds by tightly banked turns
and if this is detected, the severity of the manoeuvre should be reduced immediately.
Blade stall of either type causes serious vibration and control difﬁculty before the
loss of lift becomes signiﬁcant. Serious alternating stresses are set up and can cause
blade delamination.

The never exceed speed for the machine, Vne , will be set at a value which avoids
advancing blade compressibility stall.

3.24 The speed limit
The pure helicopter is forever trapped in a forward ﬂight region where it can retain
control and contain blade forces. Figure 3.29 shows the constraints. The airspeed is
added to the tip speed on the advancing blade, and this must be kept below about 0.92
of the speed of sound to avoid excessive noise and blade forces. On the other hand the
airspeed is subtracted from the tip speed on the retreating blade and the advance ratio
has to be kept below about 0.5 to avoid a large reverse ﬂow area and retreating blade
stall. As a result the pure helicopter with ideal tip speed is unable to exceed about 200
knots at the extreme right of the envelope of Figure 3.29.
If outright speed is not a priority, the possible range of tip speeds is greater. The
upper limit is set by noise and the lower limit by the requirement to store enough
kinetic energy to handle an engine failure. If a rotor has to provide thrust as well as
lift it will be tilted well forward at high speed and the hull will be creating a lot of drag
because of its nose down attitude. Higher speeds can be reached if an auxiliary form of
forward thrust is available because the rotor thrust can then be vertical and minimized
and the hull attitude will be better.
Westland modiﬁed the turbine exhausts to produce thrust on the speed recordbreaking Lynx, and the Lockheed Cheyenne had a second tail rotor facing rearwards

Fig. 3.29 Pure helicopter speed is forever limited by the coincidence of advancing blade compressibility
and retreating blade stall at the right of the diagram. Only compound helicopters can break this limit using
auxiliary thrust and/or wings to ofﬂoad the rotor. At lower speeds tip speed is constrained by noise and stored
energy limits.

to provide thrust for forward ﬂight as well as a ﬁxed wing to unload the rotor at high
airspeeds. These ideas will be considered in Chapter 7.

3.25 Harmonic blade motion
So far the disc has been discussed as an entity since the disc attitude determines the
path of the machine. Now the motion of the blades within the disc will be explored.
In trimmed translational ﬂight the application of cyclic feathering opposes the lift
asymmetry. Cyclic feathering changes the blade pitch angle sinusoidally. If the lift
asymmetry were also sinusoidal, the two effects would be in constant balance. Unfortunately this is not the case. Sinusoidal cyclic feathering is not strictly what is needed,
but for practical reasons it is the most widely used solution. Cyclic feathering can only
make the average lift moment the same on both sides of the disc. It cannot keep the lift
of an individual blade constant at all angles of rotation.
Figure 3.30 shows what happens to a blade element as it rotates in forward ﬂight
with cyclic pitch applied. The diagram assumes uniform inﬂow across the disc and
neglects coning for simplicity. Figure 3.30(a) shows the relative airspeed experienced
by a blade element. The rotational speed produces a constant component, but the
forward speed appears as a sinusoidal component to the revolving blade, adding speed
to the advancing blade and subtracting it from the retreating blade. The lift generated
by a blade is proportional to the square of the airspeed and this parameter is shown
in Figure 3.30(b). Note that the squaring process makes the function at 90◦ very much
greater than at 270◦ .
The coefﬁcient of lift of the blade element is nearly proportional to the angle of
attack. The collective pitch setting results in a constant component of the angle of attack
and the cyclic pitch control causes this to become a shifted or offset sinusoid as shown
in Figure 3.30(c). Figure 3.30(d) shows the lift function which is the angle of attack
multiplied by the square of the airspeed. In other words waveform (d) is the product
of (b) and (c). The amplitude of the cyclic control in (c) has been chosen to make the
lift at 90◦ the same as the lift at 270◦ . Note that although the lift on the two sides of
the rotor has been made the same by the application of cyclic feathering, the lift is not
constant.
Unfortunately a sinusoidal function cannot cancel a sine-squared function. There is
a lift trough at about 270◦ where the square of the relative airspeed has become very
low and increasing the angle of attack fails completely to compensate. Lift symmetry
is only obtained because the same cyclic input also strongly reduces the angle of attack
at 90◦ . As a result there will be lift troughs at 90◦ and 270◦ .
The lift function contains a Fourier series of harmonics, or frequencies at integer
multiples of the fundamental, which is the rotor speed. As the lift troughs on the
two sides of the rotor are not the same shape, signiﬁcant levels of odd harmonics will
exist, especially the third and ﬁfth harmonics. The lift function excites the blades in
the ﬂapping direction and they will respond according to the dynamic characteristics
of the blade and its damping. The result is that the blades do not describe a perfect
coning motion in forward ﬂight, but as shown in Figure 3.31, they weave in and out
of the cone due to the harmonics. Figure 3.31(a) shows second harmonic ﬂapping,
completing two cycles per revolution, whereas Figure 3.31(b) shows third harmonic
ﬂapping. The ﬂapping action directly modulates the axial thrust delivered to the mast
causing a hull motion variously described as ‘hopping’ or ‘plunging’.

sinusoidal variation. (b) Lift is proportional to airspeed squared. (c) Sinusoidal control of angle of attack due to
application of forward cyclic. (d) Non-constant lift around the disc is a source of vibration.

3.26 Sources of vibration
Whilst vibration in the hover can be minimized by attention to dynamic balance and
tracking, vibration in translational ﬂight is inevitable because of the varying conditions
caused by the alternate advancing and retreating of each blade. This causes harmonic
ﬂapping and dragging of the blades, resulting in forcing functions at the hub which
may be axial, i.e. along the mast, lateral, i.e. tending to cause rocking, or torsional, i.e.
tending to twist the mast.
On the retreating blade, the lift on the blade is concentrated near the tip with download near the root. This is because of the reverse ﬂow area shown in Figure 3.22. As
the same blade moves over the tail boom and into the advancing position, the lift distribution changes so that the lift is now generated more inboard. If the blade is twisted,
the angle of attack at the tip may be negative at high forward speeds resulting in a
download. The situation is now exactly the reverse of the retreating case. Clearly the
blade is being excited by time varying forces and as it is not rigid it will ﬂex.

(b)

Fig. 3.31 Lift on a given blade is not constant, but a function of azimuth angle. This results in harmonic blade
ﬂapping. (a) shows second harmonic ﬂapping. (b) shows third harmonic ﬂapping.

Centrifugal stiffening keeps the blades taut giving them certain of the characteristics
of the string of a musical instrument, except that the tension is not constant but is a
function of radius. The response to excitation by a Fourier series is shown in Figure 3.32.
A variety of harmonic structures will occur. At low frequencies the blade motion can be
considered a form of ﬂapping. At some higher frequency it will have to be considered
a vibration. Note that blades carried on ﬂapping bearings (a) will have a different
harmonic response to that of hingeless blades. Teetering rotors and hingeless rotors
have a different harmonic structure (b) from articulated rotors because the blades are
ﬁxed together in the centre of the rotor.
When a blade ﬂexes, the CM of the blade elements must be closer to the rotor axis
than when the blade is straight. Thus the blade mass is being hauled in and out against
the rotational forces, modulating the blade tension. As the root tension is typically
measured in tons, it should be clear that these lateral forces are considerable.
In the presence of harmonic ﬂapping, conservation of blade momentum suggests that
there will also be harmonic dragging. The azimuthal variation in lift caused by the
application of the cyclic control will result in variations in induced drag that excite
the blade in the dragging plane. This will be compounded by the azimuthal variation
in proﬁle drag. The blade will respond to these dragging excitations as a function of
its dynamics and damping. When the blade drags, the effective moment-arm at which
the blade outward pull is applied to the hub changes. Thus even if the blade pull were

modes. (a) Modes for an articulated rotor in which the blades are hinged at the root. (b) Modes for a teetering
or stiff hingeless rotor in which moments can pass from one blade to the other.

constant, the moment applied to the mast would be modulated. However, the blade
pull is not constant because of blade ﬂexing.
The application of cyclic pitch and the variations in airspeed seen by a blade segment
will result in chord-wise movement of the centre of pressure which will excite the blade
in torsion, placing alternating stresses on the pitch control mechanism.
A further complexity is that the ﬁnite number of blades in a real rotor cannot create
a uniform downwash. The downwash velocity changes at the blade passing frequency.
Figure 3.33 shows that in forward ﬂight a given blade element traces out a path known
as a cycloid. This path will take the blade element across its own path and those of a
number of other blades depending on the forward speed and the number of blades. As
the blade element crosses a previous path, the higher downwash velocity will reduce the
angle of attack, whereas between the previous paths the angle of attack will increase.
The result is that the lift of a particular blade element is modulated by the wakes of
previous blades. Over most of the rotation the effect is generally not serious because

102 The Art of the Helicopter

blade passes and falls in between. A ﬁxed point on a blade will cross its own path and the paths of other blades
in forward ﬂight.

the point on the blade at which the lift dips is constantly changing in radius. However,
it can be seen from Figure 3.33 that at about 60◦ of azimuth the blade is nearly parallel
to the cycloid, meaning that a signiﬁcant length of the blade is experiencing the effect
at the same time.
The non-uniformity of the downwash will also directly excite the hull and is commonly observed as ﬂexing of the canopy at the blade passing frequency. In the absence
of vibration structurally transmitted from the rotor, this mechanism will still vibrate
the hull.
In addition to the vibration sources noted above, in some ﬂight regimes the rotor
may ingest its own tip vortices. These are mostly carried away by downwash in powered
ﬂight or upwash in autorotation, but in some conditions, such as the end of a landing
approach or a roll manoeuvre, the vortex from one blade may hit the next blade headon. Figure 3.34(a) shows that the effect of a vortex approaching a blade is a local
modulation of the RAF direction causing a dip in the angle of attack. Figure 3.34(c)
shows that as the vortex leaves the blade the angle of attack is increased. The time taken
for the blade to transit the vortex is only a few milliseconds and so the resulting pressure
dipulse shown at (c) produces audio frequencies. This is the origin of blade slap.
In order to simplify study and to allow comparison between rotors turning at different
speeds, the frequencies of vibration are always divided by the rotor frequency. Thus the
units of vibration are not cycles per second but cycles per revolution. An imbalanced
rotor will cause a lateral vibration at the rotor frequency having a vibration frequency
of one cycle per rev. This is usually abbreviated to ‘one-per’.
In establishing the effect on the hull of vibrations created in the rotor, it is vital
to appreciate that there are two completely different mechanisms at work. Vibrations
in the direction of the mast axis and torsional vibrations about the mast axis are
directly transmitted and will be felt in the hull at the same frequency. However, the
rotor is turning with a frequency of its own and so vibrations in the plane of the rotor
are taking place in a rotating frame of reference. When these vibrations reach the hull,
which is in a stationary frame of reference, the same frequency will not be felt. Instead,

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 103

Fig. 3.34 (a) A blade element encountering a vortex from an earlier blade will experience ﬁrst an increase in
angle of attack (a), then a reduction (b). The variations in angle of attack produce a pressure dipulse (c) rapid
enough to be audible as blade slap.

in the case of lateral (in-plane) directions the vibration frequencies beat or heterodyne
with the rotor frequency to produce sum and difference frequencies.
The concept of sidebands was discussed in section 2.11, but the result can be demonstrated graphically. It is possible conceptually to replace the blade generating in-plane
vibrations due to modulation of its root pull with a device generating the same vibration.
This consists of a pair of contra-rotating eccentrics called a Lanchester exciter shown in
Figure 3.35(a) which produces linear sinusoidal vibration. Figure 3.35(b) shows that if
the rotor blades vibrate radially at the second harmonic (two-per) this can be simulated
by an exciter which makes two revolutions with respect to the blade in one rotor revolution. The result is that one of the eccentrics makes three revolutions with respect to the
hull whilst the other makes only one. Thus a two-per in-plane blade vibration results in
three-per and one-per at the hub in stationary co-ordinates. Third harmonic vibration
produces four-per and two-per vibration in stationary co-ordinates and so on.
The discussion so far has considered the action of individual blades. However, in
practice the hub will vectorially sum all of the forces and moments acting on it. Vectorial
summation must consider the phase of the contributions from each blade. Clearly the
phase difference between the blades is given by 360◦ divided by the number of blades.
The overall result must then also depend on the number of blades in the rotor. If the
blades are identical, and experience the same forces as they turn, they will develop
the same vibration, except that the phase will be different for each blade. If, however,
one blade has different characteristics to the others, a one-per function may result.
It is interesting to see how the number of blades affects the spectrum of vibration and
how this effect is different for in-plane vibrations. Figure 3.36(a) depicts a two-bladed
rotor and shows a graph of the fundamental ﬂapping for each blade (one-per) and the
second harmonic (two-per). Note that the two blades are 180◦ apart and so the one-per
waveforms are in anti-phase and cancel. As one-per ﬂapping is the result of tilting the
disc this is no surprise and remains true for any number of blades. However, note that
the second harmonic ﬂapping of the two blades is in-phase and will therefore add.

(b)

Fig. 3.35 (a) A pair of contra-rotating eccentrics produces linear vibration. (b) If the mechanism of (a) is rotated,
one of the eccentrics will turn faster and the other slower. Thus frequencies transmitted to the hull will be the
vibration frequency plus or minus the rotor frequency.

It will be clear that a two-bladed rotor is at a disadvantage because both blades will be
in the lift trough simultaneously at 90◦ and 270◦ , and in a lift peak simultaneously at 0◦
and 180◦ . The result at high speed is a vertical vibration known as 2P hop. Figure 3.36(b)
shows the situation for the third ﬂapping harmonic. As the third harmonic ﬂapping
has one and a half cycles in the time between blade passings, it will be clear that the
3P components will be out of phase between the two blades. Following similar logic it
should be clear that in a two-bladed rotor, only even vertical harmonics exist; the odd
ones cancel.
Figure 3.37 shows the case for a three-bladed rotor. At (a) it will be seen that the
second ﬂapping harmonic waveform of each blade is at 120◦ to that of the next. The sum
of three sine waves at 120◦ is constant and so there can be no 2P hop in a three-bladed

rotor, or indeed for a rotor with a higher number of blades. In Figure 3.37(b) is shown
the effect for the third ﬂapping harmonic. Here the third harmonic waveform is in the
same phase for each blade and so there will be summation.
Now that the general principle is clear, the result for any number of blades and any
harmonic can readily be established. This is summarized in Figure 3.38(a) where it will
be seen that the lowest hopping frequency is numerically equal to the number of blades
and that these frequencies may be multiplied by integers to ﬁnd the higher hopping
modes.
When in-plane forces are considered, the results are quite different. Figure 3.38(b)
shows the result of various harmonics with different numbers of blades. These forces
will be heterodyned by rotor speed so that the result on the hull of a rotor frequency nP
will be vibration at (n − 1)P and (n + 1)P whereas the frequency P is absent. Following
the principles of vector summation explained above, certain harmonics cancel at the
hub. Note that as with hop forces, the lowest frequencies at which rocking forces can
exist are numerically the same as the number of blades, with the harmonics obtained by
integer multiplication. The difference between Figure 3.38(a) and Figure 3.38(b) is that

zero. (b) Third harmonic ﬂapping is in the same phase in each blade and so will add.

different frequencies at the blades are responsible for the same frequencies at the hull.
For example, a ﬁve-bladed rotor can suffer 5P hopping and rocking, but the hopping
is due to blade ﬂapping at 5P whereas the rocking is due to blade ﬂapping at 4P.
This section has concentrated on the main rotor, but clearly a tail rotor will show
many of the same effects as it too is passing edge-on through the air. However, the
tail rotor is at a further disadvantage because it is working in airﬂow that has been
disturbed by the main rotor and the hull. This will be considered further in Chapter 5.

3.27 Vibration control
Vibration and helicopters are inseparable. However well balanced the rotor may be, the
lift asymmetry in forward ﬂight will cause vibration. Vibration is unwelcome because

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 106 — #46

characteristics to axial modes because frequencies are heterodyned by the rotor frequency.

it has a number of negative effects. Section 3.26 showed some of the many causes of
vibration and it should be clear that many of these may result in severe alternating
stresses in the rotor head, the blade roots, the pitch control mechanism and the transmission. This has a large impact on the service life of such parts where a failure cannot
be tolerated. Many parts need to have more generous cross-sections, increasing mass
and reducing payload. Periodic checking for cracks adds to maintenance costs.
A key problem due to vibration is that it impairs the pilot’s vision. The human visual
system (HVS) obtains its acuity by averaging visual information over a considerable
length of time. In the presence of vibration, the image will be unstable on the retina and
will thus appear blurred. There have been cases where damage to rotating components
has caused vibration severe enough that the pilot was unable to read the instruments at
all. Vibration contributes to pilot stress and workload. One of the earliest approaches
therefore was to reduce vibration at the pilot’s seat.
Given the low load factor of a helicopter, the hull is not highly stressed and could be
very lightly built were it not for fatigue inducing vibration. Increasingly helicopters

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 107 — #47

108 The Art of the Helicopter
incorporate electronic systems and sensors used either to control or navigate the
machine or as part of its mission equipment. Electronic equipment does not take
kindly to vibration, or if specially adapted, must be more expensive.
Vibrating masses are a common origin of sound, so it follows that a vibrating helicopter will be noisy both inside and out. External noise causes disturbance in civil
operations and may compromise military missions. A signiﬁcant part of the design process of the modern helicopter is taken up in minimizing noise and vibration. There are a
number of approaches that will be combined in various ways. Study of the aerodynamic
origins of vibration may allow a reduction at the source. Once the forcing frequencies
are known, the design of the structure should ensure that resonant responses to those
frequencies are minimized. This is known as detuning. Vibration may be isolated or
decoupled in some way, damped using lossy materials to convert ﬂexing into heat, or
opposed or absorbed through various cancelling techniques, both passive and active.
The reduction of the vibration at source has to be the technically superior solution.
The disadvantage of decoupling the vibration from the passengers is that although their
comfort is improved, the vibration experienced by the parts that are not decoupled
may actually increase. It is easy to see why. For a given exciting force, the amplitude
of a vibration is inversely proportional to the mass being vibrated. In a conventional
helicopter the dominant masses are those of the transmission, hull and payload. If the
hull and payload are decoupled, the mass seen by the vibration source is now only that
of the transmission and the amplitude of the vibration there must be greater and not
necessarily beneﬁcial.
An obvious way of reducing vibration at source is to use non-sinusoidal cyclic pitch
control that allows the lift moment to be more nearly constant as the blade turns.
The means to do this are non-trivial and are described in section 3.28. Another way
of reducing vibration is to use more blades. This has several advantages. First, the
load on each blade is reduced and with it the magnitude of the forcing function of
each blade. Second, the more blades, the higher the frequency of the vibration will be
and the lower will be the amplitude for a given mass. Figure 3.37 shows that a threebladed rotor eliminates the 2P hop of the two-bladed rotor, whereas a four-bladed rotor
reintroduces some 2P lateral vibration. It will be seen from Figure 3.38(b) that an even
number of blades gives lower rocking frequencies, making an odd number preferable.
Consequently the change from four to ﬁve blades gives a signiﬁcant improvement. Large
transport helicopters inevitably have a large and generally odd number of blades – seven
or nine – simply to contain the large vibrations that must result from generating high
rotor thrust. Using many blades will be expensive and result in a large rotor head having
high drag.
It is common to design the blades so that their natural frequencies of vibration are
not in the spectrum of the excitation. If any of the excitation frequencies coincide
with the resonant frequencies there could be a signiﬁcant response at that frequency.
Any coincidence can be seen from an interference diagram as shown in Figure 3.39.
This interference diagram is for the Westland Lynx and shows the operating speed
(318 RPM) as a vertical line. The excitation frequency may be at any integer multiple
of the rotor frequency. Figure 3.39 shows that, as rotor speed increases, the excitation
harmonics (thin lines starting at the origin) fan out. The resonant frequencies of the
blades also change with rotor frequency because of the effect of centrifugal stiffening.
Figure 3.39 shows how ﬂapping, ωf , and lagging, ωl, resonant frequencies may change
with rotor speed.
The only coincidence between excitation and response is the close correspondence
between the fundamental ﬂapping resonant frequency and the rotor fundamental frequency. This is the characteristic that results in rotor precession. Note that as the Lynx

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 108 — #48

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 109

Fig. 3.39 The excitation spectrum in a rotor fans out at RRPM increases. The natural frequencies of ﬂapping
and dragging of the blade will also change with RRPM due to centrifugal stiffening. If these two effects are
superimposed, it is possible to see where the excitation frequencies coincide with response frequencies. This
is known as an interference diagram. (AugustaWestland)

has a hingeless rotor, the ﬂapping resonance is above the rotor frequency and so the
rotor phase lag will be less than 90◦ .
In all other cases, coincidence is avoided so that at normal RRPM no resonances
are excited. This result was not an accident. During the design process the blade was
designed with a tapering spar resulting in the stiffness and the mass per unit length
being non-uniform so that the ﬂapping resonant frequencies are not integer multiples
of the fundamental. Where constructional techniques such as extrusion do not allow
the blade or spar to taper, the blades can also be detuned by placing weights at critical
points along the span so that the effective mass per unit length is no longer uniform.
Note that the technique of detuning only works at one rotor speed, at other speeds the
excitation frequency is different and the response will also differ. Detuning will also be
employed in the hull so that hull resonance does not magnify rotor-induced vibrations.

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 109 — #49

110 The Art of the Helicopter
Although vibration may occur at a number of frequencies, often one of these will
dominate and cause a problem. Vibration absorbers are devices intended to reduce
vibration at a single speciﬁc frequency. The term is actually a misnomer because what
they actually do is to create an opposing or near-anti-phase vibration. These devices
work using mechanical resonance.
As was seen in section 2.9, a mass supported on a spring displays resonance. If the
damping is very low, the phase response just above the resonant frequency becomes
nearly 180◦ . If the resonant frequency is set just below the frequency of vibration,
the mass will automatically resonate in inverse phase and oppose the vibration. In
helicopters the battery may be used as a suitable mass and this is supported on carefully
calibrated springs. A mass absorber of this kind can only reduce vibration in the vicinity
of the device itself. Flexibility of the hull will allow vibration elsewhere; however, such
devices can oppose the hull vibration due to non-uniform downwash. Mass absorbers
only work at a ﬁxed frequency and require the rotor to turn at a precisely controlled
RPM. The alternative is to use a system in which the spring stiffness can be modiﬁed
by a servo so that the absorber can be tuned to the actual RRPM in use. Such a system
is ﬁtted in the Chinook. In some early helicopters vibrations fed into the control rods
were opposed in this way. Figure 3.40(a) shows a resonator consisting of a bob weight
on a leaf spring attached to a control bell crank.
A pendulum is a kind of resonator. The type used in a clock uses the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld to provide the restoring force. In helicopters, pendular vibration absorbers
ﬁtted on rotors use the acceleration caused by rotation. Figure 3.40(b) shows that pendular absorbers used to handle ﬂapping vibration consist of weights that can swing on
the end of cranked shafts pivoted in the blade roots. When the rotor is turning, the
weights ﬂy out horizontally and attempt to stay in the same plane. Vertical movement of
the blade excites the pendulum which is tuned to resonate in anti-phase. These devices
can be seen on the Kamov Ka-32 and on the Bo-105 and are known colloquially as
bull’s balls.
As these devices employ resonance, a single unit can only oppose vibration at a single
frequency. However, it is possible to ﬁt more than one pendulum to the same mounting.
The Hughes 500 has a four-bladed rotor and so according to Figure 3.38(b) will be
prone to 4P rocking forces due to ﬂapping at 3P and 5P. The two pendula are tuned to
the third and ﬁfth harmonics of blade ﬂapping.
Torsional vibration of the rotor shaft may be due to blade excitation in the dragging
plane. This is an application for the biﬁlar pendulum. A pendulum can be made to swing
in one axis only by attaching it with two strings, hence the name. Restoration forces are
much smaller for in-plane motion, suggesting that a pendulum would need a very short
arm in order to resonate at a harmonic of rotor frequency. Thus in practice the arms are
replaced by a pair of pins which operate in oversized holes as in Figure 3.40(c). As the
weight moves to one side, the geometry of the pins moves the weight inwards. As
the weight tends to ﬂy out as the rotor turns, there will be a restoring force if the weight
is displaced. This is all that is necessary to create a resonant system.
The restoring force that determines the resonant frequency in pendulum and biﬁlar
absorbers comes from the acceleration due to rotation. This is a function of RRPM,
as is the frequency to be absorbed. Consequently these devices are self-tuning.
Another popular and obvious way of isolating vibration is to use ﬂexible mountings
between the transmission and the hull. It is a fundamental concept of such mounts
that there will be a resonance whose frequency is determined by the sprung mass and
the stiffness of the mounts. The degree of isolation is proportional to the difference
between that resonant frequency and the frequency to be ﬁltered out. Consequently
the lowest possible resonant frequency is required. This frequency may be lowered by

softening the mounts, or by increasing the supported mass. Soft mounts may cause
other problems, such as handling difﬁculties because the hull would tend not to follow
the rotor in a manoeuvre. As a result, the best solution is to increase the mass to be
isolated as much as possible.
This is the principle of the machinery raft, which is a rigid structure carrying the
engines, transmission, control actuators, oil coolers, generators, etc. as a single unit.
This raft is then mounted to the hull by widely spaced resilient supports. The large
mass of the raft opposes the forcing function of the rotor and makes the resonant
frequency as low as possible, as well as reducing the amplitude of vibration seen by the
components on the raft.
The problem with resilient supports is that for good isolation they have to be soft,
and this will always result in a static deﬂection. Some techniques have been developed
for helicopters to circumvent the problem. Figure 3.41(a) shows a system developed by
Kaman known as DAVI, or dynamic anti-resonant vibration isolator. This works using
a mechanical impedance convertor to raise the moving mass artiﬁcially. Between the
transmission and the hull is a lever carrying a bob weight. The mechanical advantage of

Fig. 3.41 (a) In a dynamic anti-vibration isolator, a lever is used to amplify the motion of a weight thus giving

nodes where the hull is attached.

the lever causes any relative motion to be ampliﬁed. The lever changes the mechanical
impedance of the bob weight by a factor equal to the square of the mechanical advantage. Thus a 1 kg weight on a 10 : 1 lever would appear to weigh 100 kg. Mounting
the transmission on, for example, four such mounts would raise the effective weight
by 400 kg. Given the increase in apparent weight of the transmission, the supporting
spring can be made much stiffer than would be possible with a conventional resilient
mount, without increasing the resonant frequency.
Figure 3.41(b) shows the nodal beam system developed by Bell. At one time most
Bell helicopters had two blades and suffered 2P hop. The nodal beam was developed
to isolate the hop. Between the hull and the transmission is a ﬂexible beam made from
a sandwich of elastomer and steel. The transmission mounts are closer together on the
beam than the hull mounts. As relative movement takes place between the hull and
the transmission, the beam must bend. The proximity of the hull and transmission
mounts makes a virtual lever system resulting in larger amplitude of movement at the
centre of the beam. The effective mass of the beam is ampliﬁed by the mechanical
advantage of the virtual levers, making the system mathematically equivalent to a pair
of DAVI isolators in parallel. The geometry of the system is tailored so that at the
bending resonant frequency of the beam the hull attachment points are at nodes and
so do not move.
In active vibration cancelling systems, Figure 3.42, a number of high speed actuators,
typically hydraulically operated, are used to attach the hull to the transmission. The
actuators are controlled by signals from processors and accelerometers in the hull. The
signal processors are needed to adapt the waveforms fed to the actuators to changing
conditions such as all up weight and airspeed. An increase in all up weight would

suitable forcing function to cancel the vibration.

require increased static pressure in the actuators to prevent them extending. In practice
a feedback mechanism measures the average extension of the actuator and centralizes
each one with a relatively long time constant.
No practical hull can be rigid, and so there will be various modes of vibration excited
in it. One of the sources of vibration will be due to the non-uniform downwash impinging on the hull surface. Conventional isolators between hull and transmission can do
nothing about this because they only oppose structure-borne vibration. However, an
active system can use the transmission as a reaction mass to create forces opposing
vibration from any source. Unfortunately the amplitude of vibration in the transmission will be increased. Better results may be obtained by applying active control to a
raft carrying the engines, etc. as described above.

3.28 Harmonic pitch control
It was seen in Figure 3.30 that the use of sinusoidal feathering in a cyclic pitch control is
incorrect. The airspeed seen by a blade element changes sinusoidally in forward ﬂight,
but the lift is proportional to the square of the airspeed. This non-linear function generates ﬂapping harmonics that cannot be cancelled by sinusoidal feathering. It follows
immediately that if there are to be no ﬂapping harmonics, the feathering function must
contain harmonics.
A harmonic cyclic pitch waveform is approximately a square root function of a raised
sine wave although some modiﬁcation will be necessary because of inﬂow effects. When
multiplied by the sine-squared function due to the speed, the product, namely the
lift, is constant. The pitch function above will need further reﬁnement to account for
upwash at the leading edge of the disc. Figure 3.43 shows how an actuator between the
swashplate and the blade control arm could add the harmonic control.
In practice perfect constant lift can only be achieved at one radius, but it should be
possible to ﬁnd a pitch function that makes the average blade lift moment essentially
constant. A more advanced system would have means to control the angle of attack
of different parts of the blade independently. This may be possible using, for example,
piezo-electric actuators. It is impossible to obtain constant lift over the whole blade
because of the reverse ﬂow area, and so some harmonic ﬂapping will always remain.
Whilst theoretically obvious, harmonic blade control, also known as higher harmonic
control, is rarely found. One of the difﬁculties is that the cyclic control becomes a

114 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 3.43 In harmonic pitch control, the blade pitch is not sinusoidal, but has a waveform calculated to make
the lift more uniform around the disc. This may be controlled by an actuator between the swashplate and the
blade pitch control arm.

function of airspeed, returning to a near sinusoidal function in the hover. This is
probably beyond what might be achieved mechanically but some kind of electronic
system would easily generate the required functions. High speed actuators are necessary
to drive the blade feathering, and the blades must be torsionally stiff in order to respond
to the rapid pitch variations. Another consideration is that as the number of blades
increases the effects of lift troughs are averaged out more and there is less of a problem.
However, the elegant result of constant lift moment around the disc is one that
is most desirable. The reduction in vibration makes the ﬂight more comfortable for
passengers and prolongs the life of the machine. A further consequence of constant lift
is a reduction in power needed in forward ﬂight. In a conventional rotor the increased
power needed where the lift is greatest is not balanced by a reduction in power where
the lift troughs are. Consequently constant lift needs the least power.
It would seem clear that the greatest cost beneﬁt of harmonic blade control would be
in the two-bladed helicopter where the 2P hop could be eliminated. The improvement
in ride would be greatest but the number of actuators needed is least. In some light
helicopters a two-bladed harmonically controlled rotor could replace a conventional
three-bladed rotor and the overall cost might be the same. At some point designers will
ﬁnd ways of economically achieving the goal of constant lift. Some experiments have
been done with systems which rock a conventional swashplate, but this cannot give the
required result as each blade needs to be individually controlled.

3.29 Blade design
The helicopter blade is a complex subject because of the number of interacting variables
involved. These will be considered here. It might be thought that the aerodynamic
characteristics of the blade would be determined only by shape. In general this is
untrue. Figure 3.44 shows some of the issues. The long thin structure of a practical
blade can never be rigid and ﬂight loads will cause the blade to ﬂex. However, it is
not enough to know the stiffness of the blade to calculate the result. In forward ﬂight
the loads have a powerful alternating component and this generates harmonics. At the
frequencies of the higher harmonics the motion may be mass controlled. A further
complexity is that the ﬂexing of the blade will affect the aerodynamics; a phenomenon

Introduction to helicopter dynamics 115

Fig. 3.44 The aeroelasticity effect loop in a rotor blade. The blades are not rigid and can ﬂex. This will affect
their local angle of attack, changing the lift distribution that in turn causes ﬂexing.

This is a stable condition as wash-out reduces the lift. (b) If the trailing edge is stiffer than the leading edge,

disintegrate.

called aeroelasticity. As it is clear that the aerodynamics affect the ﬂexing, then there
is a loop. This loop may be stable or unstable. Part of the design process must be to
ensure that aeroelastic effects always result in blade stability.
The shape of the blade is completely deﬁned by the root cut-out, the tip shape, the
degree of twist and taper and by the blade section used, which may change with radius.
Assuming ﬁrst a rigid blade, the blade shape will allow the time variant aerodynamic
forces to be predicted in a given ﬂight regime. The way the blade responds to this
excitation is complicated. The torsional forces depend on the locus of the centre of
pressure with respect to the mass centroid. The effect of ﬂight loads on blade twisting
is signiﬁcant because twist will alter the local angle of attack as well as feeding loads
back into the control system. The degree of twisting depends on the moment of inertia,
the stiffness, the damping and the frequency.
The chord-wise distribution of stiffness needs to be known accurately. Figure 3.45(a)
shows a blade in which the leading edge is stiffer than the trailing edge. The application
of lift at the centre of pressure causes the blade to wash out; a stable condition. However,
Figure 3.45(b) shows a blade in which the trailing edge is stiffer than the leading
edge. Here lift causes the blade to wash in; leading to ﬂutter. As a result blades are

“helic - CHAP03” — 2003/11/22 — page 115 — #55

116 The Art of the Helicopter
generally constructed in such a way that the mass centroid and the centre of bending
stiffness is well forward on the chord. The result is a section where the structural mass
is concentrated in a D-shaped structure at the leading edge, with the trailing part of
the section being comprised of a low density structure.
Blade taper is not always employed because in practice the penalty of a constant
chord blade is only a few per cent. Taper prevents constructional techniques such as
extrusion that requires a constant section. Blade twist is advantageous in hover, but the
ideal amount for hover will be detrimental in translational ﬂight because the application
of cyclic pitch may cause the ﬁnely pitched blade tips to go to a negative angle of attack.
The exception to this restriction is in the tilt rotor aircraft that both hovers and cruises
with axial inﬂow. This gives the designer more freedom to use blade twist and this is
clearly visible in rotors of the Bell-Boeing Osprey.

Rotors in practice

4.1 Introduction
The loads on the rotor blades are large and time variant and the articulated head was
developed to minimize them. Articulation also reduces the rate at which the aircraft
responds to the controls. In this chapter the dynamics and control of the articulated
rotor will be introduced, along with later developments such as hingeless rotors that
became possible with the development of modern materials.
The essential functions of the rotor head are to transfer shaft power to the blades, to
transfer the resulting rotor thrust to the mast, to resist the blade tension and yet to allow
the blades to move on their feathering axes so that cyclic and collective pitch control
is possible. This simple and elegant arrangement was initially not possible because it
requires extremely strong materials. Thus practical rotor heads are often much more
complex.
Figure 4.1 demonstrates that the rotor blade of a typical helicopter pulls outwards
with a force roughly equal to the weight of a bus. It’s no wonder those ﬂoppy blades
straighten out. It requires little imagination to predict what would happen if a blade
attachment failed. Clearly the rotor head has to be extremely strong and reliable and
as a result it is one of the heaviest individual components in the machine.

Fig. 4.1 Given the coning angle and the weight of the helicopter, the blade root tension follows. Here it will
be seen that the same coning angle could be obtained by suspending the helicopter on cables with a bus on the
other end. Blade attachments have to withstand tremendous loads yet allow the blades to feather.

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 117 — #1

118 The Art of the Helicopter

4.2 Why articulated rotors are used
The variation in lift, lift distribution and drag as the blades turn, especially in forward ﬂight, produces alternating stresses which can fatigue materials. The adoption
of articulation was ﬁrst suggested by Renard in 1904 and was essential in early rotorcraft to reduce the stresses involved, particularly the alternating stresses in the blades
and the moments applied to the mast when rolling and pitching manoeuvres are performed. Some texts claim that articulation is necessary to handle the lift asymmetry in
translational ﬂight, but this is quite incorrect.
In addition to the feathering bearing, the fully articulated rotor head carries each
blade on freely turning bearings which allow ﬂapping, or movement above or below
the plane of the rotor head, and dragging, a swinging movement in the plane of the
blades which is also called lead/lag. The presence of the ﬂapping and dragging bearings
means that moments about their axes cannot be transferred from the rotor head to the
blades, and so bending stresses in the blade roots are dramatically reduced.
Figure 4.2(a) shows one arrangement which has been widely used by, for example,
Sikorsky and Enstrom. The feathering bearing is outboard of the ﬂapping bearing.
This arrangement has the advantage that the loads fed into the control system when
the blades ﬂap and drag are minimized. The ﬂapping and dragging hinges can be
displaced or coincident in various designs and this is considered in section 4.7.
If the axes of the ﬂapping hinges pass through the shaft axis, the result is called a
zero-offset rotor head and these will be considered in section 4.10. In a conventional
articulated head, the ﬂapping bearings are horizontally displaced, or offset, typically
by a few per cent of the rotor diameter, and it will be seen from Figure 4.2(b) that
blade tension can produce a control moment on the rotor head if the shaft is not at
right angles to the tip path plane. Consequently the hull tends to follow the disc better
when offset is employed and so the machine becomes more manoeuvrable, although a
stronger mast is needed to withstand the moments.

4.3 Axes galore
Whether by ﬂexing or by movement of a bearing, each blade can ﬂap and feather as it
rotates. A consequence of these degrees of freedom is that three rotational axes need
to be considered when studying the behaviour of a turning rotor. The way in which
these axes interrelate is fascinating and allows an insight into the behaviour of a blade
in ﬂight.
Figure 4.3(a) shows a helicopter with an articulated rotor in forward ﬂight. The cyclic
stick will need to be trimmed forward to maintain airspeed, since this will reduce the
angle of attack of the advancing blade and increase that of the retreating blade, so that
they generate equal lift moments. The stick will also need to be trimmed towards the
retreating side to oppose the inﬂow roll. The tip path plane is tilted forward to obtain
a forward component of rotor thrust to balance drag.

4.3.1

The shaft axis

The most obvious, and least useful, of these axes is the shaft axis on which the rotor
head turns. An observer riding on the shaft axis could see ﬂapping, dragging and
feathering taking place simultaneously, but some of these motions could disappear at
certain relationships between the shaft axis and the other two axes.

the tip path plane is not orthogonal to the shaft axis.

4.3.2

The tip path axis

The axis at right angles to the tip path plane is generally called the tip path axis or disc
axis. The resultant thrust of the rotor aligns within about a degree of the tip path axis,
and for most purposes they can be considered to be coincident. The tip path axis is also
called the axis-of-no-ﬂapping in some texts, although this term is not strictly correct
because the existence of harmonics in the blade motion cause the blades to ﬂap slightly
with respect to the tip path axis. By the same token the tip path plane is not strictly a
plane.

thrust, the control axis, and the shaft axis that are generally not coincident. When observed with respect to the
control axis, the blades do not feather, but instead appear to ﬂap. Note that even a hingeless rotor with rigid
blades can ﬂap with respect to the control axis. (b) If the pitch control rods are parallel to the shaft and 90◦

difference between the tip path and control axes is equal to the amount of ﬂapping observed with respect to
the control axis and to the amount of feathering observed with respect to the tip path axis.

Rotors in practice 121

Designers often try to trim the machine so that in cruise the action of the tail plane
opposes couples due to drag on the hull in order to align the shaft axis with the tip
path axis because this minimizes the amount of ﬂapping and hence the amount of wear
and vibration. However, this will often be compromised because of variations in the
longitudinal position of the CM. In tandem helicopters it is easier to align the tip path
axis with the shaft axis. During a roll manoeuvre the tip path axis and the shaft axis
must diverge in order to roll the hull.
An observer turning with the tip path axis would see the feathering action changing
the pitch of a given blade sinusoidally about the collective pitch setting at one cycle
per revolution but as he is turning in the tip path plane he would not see any ﬂapping
(except for harmonics). In the steady hover no dragging would be observed, but in
forward ﬂight dragging would be seen due to the increased drag on the advancing
blade compared with that on the retreating blade.

4.3.3

The control axis

There exists a third axis, not parallel to the disc axis in translational ﬂight, about which
no blade feathering takes place. This is called the control axis, and it is the hardest one
to visualize. An observer turning with the control axis in forward ﬂight would note that
the pitch of the blades was constant, but that the blades ﬂapped up at the advancing
side of the nose of the machine and down at the retreating side of the tail. A given blade
would appear to drag back when advancing, and then forward when retreating. The
dragging would appear much greater than in the case of the observer on the disc axis.
As Figure 4.3(b) shows, in the special case of a two-bladed rotor, if the pitch control
rods stay parallel to the mast and are at 90◦ to the blades, the swashplate also rotates
on the control axis. The blade stays parallel to the swashplate and so cannot feather
with respect to it. In the general case the control axis and the swashplate axes are not
the same as will be seen in section 4.13.
There is an exact equivalence between the degree of ﬂapping seen by an observer on
the control axis and the degree of feathering seen by an observer on the tip path axis.
Figure 4.3(c) shows that when the control and tip path axes differ by θ ◦ , if the blades
reach a peak feathering angle of θ ◦ with respect to the tip path axis, they will ﬂap to a
peak deﬂection of θ ◦ with respect to the control axis.
The reason for the difference between the tip path axis and the control axis should
now be clear. In the hover, there would be no permanent difference as the blades
follow the cyclic stick. However, in translational ﬂight, the blades encounter highly
asymmetrical conditions that pull the tip path axis away from the control axis. In order
to ﬂy straight and level, the pilot has to ﬁnd a position for the cyclic stick in which the
asymmetrical conditions on the blades are precisely opposed by cyclic input so that the
rotor disc attitude is no longer affected by the asymmetry. For example, if at a certain
airspeed the advancing/retreating effect would result in three degrees of ﬂapback, the
application of three degrees of forward cyclic will put the rotor disc back in the attitude
it would have had in the absence of ﬂapback.
As the shaft axis and the tip path axes can be non-parallel, clearly some joints or
bearings are necessary or something must be designed to ﬂex. The ﬂapping and lagging
bearings in an articulated head approximate to a constant velocity joint between the
shaft axis and the tip path axis. The spherical bearing in the centre of the swashplate
and the feathering bearings in the rotor head allow the control axis to be different from
the shaft axis.
The motion of the blades can be studied with respect to any one of the above axes.
Each has its own merits. The use of the control axis is instructive when studying the

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 121 — #5

122 The Art of the Helicopter
helicopter in detail. For hingeless rotors use of the shaft axis has some advantages but
the tip path axis excels when discussing articulated and teetering heads because it is
easier to visualize what is taking place and the direction of the resultant rotor thrust is
clear. It is best used for ﬂying training because it is most tangible to pilots. In practice it
is useful to be able to switch conceptually from one axis to another to obtain a proper
understanding.
The control axis was naturally used in the study of the autogyro and as the theory of
the helicopter was in many ways derived from work done on the autogyro much early
helicopter analysis also uses the control axis, including the classic work by Gessow
and Myers.1 Although the authors make it perfectly clear that the control axis is being
used as a reference, not every reader understands what that means and there is scope
for misunderstanding if the axes become confused. One example is the occurrence of
numerous explanations that are seen claiming that ﬂapping hinges prevent asymmetry
of lift in translational ﬂight in gyroplanes and helicopters. This is complete nonsense
and comes about because the tip path and control axes have been confused. The blades
can ﬂap with respect to the control axis without any ﬂapping hinges or ﬂexibility at all
simply because the control axis is not parallel to the tip path axis.
It is important to appreciate that all of these axes are hypothetical and the rotor
doesn’t care how we choose to observe it. Thus whatever axis is used for analysis the
result must always be consistent with the result of an analysis on another axis. To give
an example, as the blade pitch appears constant to an observer on the control axis,
no force is necessary to make the blades perform cyclic pitch changes other than to
overcome friction in the feathering bearings. If the same analysis is carried out on the
tip path axis, the blades appear to be oscillating along the feathering axis. The effect
shown in Figure 3.8 produces a restoring action tending to return the blades to ﬂat
pitch. This causes the blades to have a torsional resonant frequency. It can be shown
that this is the same as the rotational frequency of the rotor. As a result the feathering
blades are in torsional resonance and so no force is required to operate them other than
to overcome friction. This is consistent with the analysis on the control axis.
If harmonic pitch control is used, then strictly there is no axis about which the blades
do not feather. However, the control axis could be redeﬁned as the axis about which
there is no ﬁrst harmonic feathering. In other words only the higher harmonics of
feathering would be seen with respect to the control axis. This is a reasonable approach
because the tip path plane is not really a plane because of ﬂapping harmonics and yet
the concept is still useful. Interestingly with the correct application of harmonic pitch
control the feathering will see more harmonics so that the tip path may see fewer.

4.4 Flapping
Flapping is the movement of the blade CM along the shaft axis. It was shown in
section 2.14 that the fundamental resonant frequency of the ﬂapping blade is almost the
same as the rotational frequency. With a zero-offset rotor the frequencies are identical
and this results in a 90◦ phase lag in the rotor. When ﬂapping hinge offset is used, the
resonant ﬂapping frequency rises slightly because the blades become a little shorter
without the diameter changing and the result is that the phase lag of the rotor becomes
a little less than 90◦ . This is compensated for in the design of the controls.
Flapping is self-damping because of the effect it has on relative airﬂow. When a
blade ﬂaps down, its vertical velocity adds vectorially to the airﬂow to increase the
angle of attack, providing more lift to oppose the ﬂapping. When a blade ﬂaps up, the

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 122 — #6

Rotors in practice 123

opposite occurs. As a result no additional damping is required about the ﬂapping axis,
aerodynamic damping being perfectly adequate.

4.5 Droop stops
When a rotor is turning at ﬂight RPM, centrifugal stiffening tends to hold the blades
straight and they will cone to whatever angle is necessary for a force balance in the
rotor head. With ﬂapping hinge offset, if the tip path plane tilts, a couple will be created which tilts the hull to follow. As a result the freely ﬂapping blades will not strike
the tail boom. There have been some spectacular incidents in wind tunnels where the
hull of the helicopter was ﬁxed and this mechanism could not operate.
As a rotor slows down, the blades will droop and stops are needed to restrict the
travel. These can be ﬁxed if a tall mast is used. However, Figure 4.4 shows that at ﬂight
RPM the blades are nearly straight whereas at rest they droop. Thus the actual angular
motion allowable at the head is greater when the blades are turning. This requirement
can be met by using moving droop stops which are thrown out of engagement as the
rotor speeds up, and which return under the inﬂuence of springs as it slows down. Stops
are also required to restrict the upward motion of the blade if it ‘sails’ whilst starting
up in a wind.

4.6 Introduction to dragging
In the absence of coning, the ﬂapping hinges would be sufﬁcient for the shaft axis to
tilt with respect to the tip path axis, but greater freedom is needed in the presence of
coning. Figure 4.5 shows an example of a machine hovering with the CM not directly
below the rotor head so that the mast is not vertical. When viewed along the tip path
axis at (a), the blades are evenly spaced, but when viewed along the shaft axis (b), the
blades are not evenly spaced, and dragging hinges are necessary to allow this angular
change with respect to the rotor head so that the blades can travel at constant velocity
to conserve momentum. If the blades were not allowed to drag, they would experience
alternating bending moments due to the geometrical conﬂict.
The dragging motion in the hover is due to the rotor head turning on the shaft axis
whilst the blades turn on the tip path axis. If a ﬂexible joint were installed in the rotor
shaft, the rotor head could turn on the same axis as the blades and then there would
be no dragging movement due to coning and no need for dragging hinges. A simple
ﬂexible joint such as the Hooke or universal joint used in automotive propeller shafts

Fig. 4.4 In ﬂight the blades are held straight by centrifugal stiffening. At rest the blades will droop further.
Retractable stops may be used to prevent excessive droop without limiting ﬂapping in ﬂight.

124 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 4.5 When viewed along the tip path axis, the blades are 90◦ apart in the hover, but if the CM is offset,
the shaft axis and the tip path axis are not aligned. With respect to the shaft axis the blades are not evenly
spaced. Dragging hinges allow this geometric conﬂict to be resolved.

is shown in Figure 4.6(a). This, however, does not give constant angular velocity when
it is deﬂected and this would cause torsional stress in the transmission. What is needed
is a true constant velocity joint of the type used in front-wheel-drive cars. In the LZ-5
helicopter designed by Glidden Doman a true constant velocity joint was used (b).
A rotor head having only a constant velocity joint would not be able to transmit any
moments to the mast and so would be classiﬁed as a zero-offset head. Such heads are
only suitable for lightweight machines. However, it would be possible to ﬁt springs to
the head to give it some ability to transmit moments.
Clearly the blades are being driven through the air by torque supplied to the rotor
head. In an articulated head the dragging bearings prevent torque being transmitted
to the blades. The blades actually drag back until the blade tension applied to the rotor
head is no longer truly radial but is displaced with respect to the mast axis. Figure 4.7(a)
shows that this results in the torque from the transmission being balanced in the rotor
head. The rotor head will often be constructed with a typical offset built in as shown
in (b).
Note that the blade grip attaches to the blade on the axis of the mass centroid of
the blade so that no bending stress is caused at the mounting. As the mass centroid is

set forward to about 25% of the chord for stability, the attachment point will also be
forward of the mid-chord point.
When a blade ﬂaps up, perhaps in response to a cyclic input, the centre of mass of
the blade moves towards the shaft and conservation of momentum causes the blade
to accelerate in the disc plane. This explanation is for a stationary frame of reference.
However, in a rotating frame of reference, the blade appears to be stationary and has
no momentum. In order to explain how it appears to move forward a virtual force,

called a Coriolis force, has to be imagined to act. If the head itself is completely rigid,
the in-plane blade movement due to conservation of momentum results in bending in
the blade. The resultant forces are often called Coriolis forces. In fact the forces arise
because the rigid head tends to prevent the blade conserving its momentum whereas
drag hinges allow momentum to be conserved.
In translational ﬂight there is considerable asymmetry in the conditions experienced
by the advancing and retreating blades. The most obvious consequence of this asymmetry is the application of cyclic pitch in order to produce equal lift moments on each
side of the rotor. This will result in the induced drag and the proﬁle drag being functions of blade phase angle and radius. Note that these two functions are quite different.
Figure 4.8 shows that the induced drag falls on the advancing blade because the angle
of attack is reduced, whereas the proﬁle drag increases because the velocity of the RAF
is higher. Figure 4.8 shows that, at an inboard radius, reverse ﬂow causes the root end
of the blade to develop an undesirable down force.
The result of these induced and proﬁle drag variations will be in-plane bending
moments within the blade as well as overall in-plane moments at the blade root. Dragging hinges are intended to relieve in-plane root moments. However, the presence of
dragging hinges allows in-plane blade motion and it is important that this motion is
stable. Unlike ﬂapping, the restoring force when the blade drags away from its neutral
position is quite small and so the resonant frequency is much lower than the rotational
frequency. For in-plane motion, the degree of aerodynamic damping is also very small.
It was seen in Chapter 1 that additional damping is often necessary on the dragging
axis to prevent ground resonance. This phenomenon will be discussed in sections 4.16
and 4.17.

4.7 Order of hinges
The order in which the ﬂapping, dragging and feathering hinges are disposed is subject
to a certain amount of variation from one design authority to the next. The use of
coincident ﬂapping and dragging axes is common because it allows a compact bearing

Rotors in practice 127

assembly that is particularly important on multi-blade heads, where the head can
become a serious source of drag if it is larger than necessary. Figure 4.2 showed an
example of a head in which the ﬂapping and dragging hinges are combined in a single
Hooke joint having a cruciform central member. The logical place for the feathering
bearing is outboard.
Figure 4.9(a) shows that the three hinge axes are not necessarily orthogonal. This
results in coupling between the axes, sometimes deliberate, sometimes an unavoidable
geometric compromise. A hinge has an axis and this can only uniquely be deﬁned in
three dimensions. In Figure 4.9(a) O is the rotor head, OZ is the rotor shaft axis and
OX is the blade span axis. OXY is the plane of the rotor. In an orthogonal head, OY
would be the ﬂapping axis, OZ would be the dragging axis and OX the feathering axis.

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 127 — #11

128 The Art of the Helicopter
OP is an arbitrary hinge axis and could be a ﬂapping or a lagging hinge. In the literature, the ﬂapping hinge is called the δ hinge and the dragging hinge is called the α hinge.
These hinges can be turned away from the mutually orthogonal in three axes, 1, 2 and
3. Only two of these axes are shown in Figure 4.9(a); axis 2 is redundant. If OP is a
ﬂapping hinge and is projected into the plane of the rotor, OXY, the angle between the
projection and OY is called δ3 (delta-three). If OP is projected onto the plane OZY, the
angle between the projection and OY is δ1 (delta-one). In an orthogonal head these
angles are both zero.
Figure 4.9(b) shows that to avoid coupling between ﬂapping and feathering, the
spherical bearing between the pitch control rod and the pitch control arm must be on
the axis of the ﬂapping hinge which must also be at 90◦ to the feathering axis.
The pitch control arm is generally on the leading edge of the blade. If the pitch control
arm is made slightly shorter as in Figure 4.9(c), there will be an interaction between
ﬂapping and feathering. Figure 4.9(d) reveals that upward ﬂapping will reduce the pitch
of the blade, tending to lower the blade, whereas downward ﬂapping would have the
reverse effect. Effectively a positive δ3 hinge has been created. This is a stable condition,
whereas the reverse relationship between the control rod joint and the ﬂapping axis to
give a negative δ3 hinge would be unstable.
In some autogyros the dragging hinge was inclined to produce a δ1 hinge. This had the
effect of coupling the dragging and the blade pitch to allow jump take-off. The blades
would stay in ﬁne pitch whilst being driven, but upon the drive being disconnected the
blades would swing forward, increasing the pitch.
In some toy free-ﬂying helicopters a reverse δ1 hinge is used which sets the machine
automatically into autorotation when the fuel runs out.

4.8 Types of rotor head
For many years the designer was faced with a choice between a teetering two-bladed
head and an articulated multi-bladed head. These techniques were developed because
they greatly reduce bending loads on the blades. The teetering head imposes the least
stress on the mast, but has some drawbacks as will be seen in section 4.10. In the
early years of helicopter design, available blade materials and designs precluded the
use of other types of rotor head and the drawbacks had to be accepted. Although
it is less demanding on the blades and the feathering bearings, the articulated rotor
head contains a mass of bearings subject to oscillating motion that causes wear. These
bearings require frequent replacement. Large machines may require continuous oil feed
to the bearings, whereas smaller machines require the periodic application of a grease
gun. The hingeless rotor head is a desirable goal if only because it reduces the amount
of maintenance required.
The effect of blade ﬂapping in articulated and teetering heads is also used to prevent excessively rapid response to cyclic control inputs. This will be made clear in
section 4.11.
The stress due to coning can be relieved by ﬁtting the blades at a preset coning angle.
In practice, the disc and shaft axes will be slightly different since the hull blowback will
never be perfectly balanced by the tail plane, particularly if the CM is displaced. As
the hinges are only resolving a small geometric problem, it is clear that a rotor strong
enough or ﬂexible enough to accommodate the geometric conﬂict can dispense with
actual ﬂapping and dragging hinges. The result is a hingeless rotor. The term ‘rigid
rotor’ is sometimes used to describe such a system, but clearly it is a misnomer and the
term hingeless is to be preferred.

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 128 — #12

Rotors in practice 129

Pitch change or feathering is, of course, still necessary, and this may be achieved by an
actual bearing or by a further degree of ﬂexural freedom. The feathering bearing must
be able to withstand the ﬂapping and dragging moments in addition to the axial pull.
Although the elimination of hinges reduces maintenance, it is not necessarily a
goal to reduce ﬂapping. An articulated rotor can ﬂap to decouple rapid variations
in thrust from the hull. There is thus a good argument for a rotor head that combines the mechanical simplicity of the hingeless head with the ride quality of the
articulated head. As will be seen in section 4.11, the designer can make different compromises between ride quality and manoeuvrability by changing the stiffness of the
ﬂexures.

4.9 Zero-offset heads
The main characteristic of the zero-offset head is that the blades cannot transfer
moments to the mast, and the helicopter hull hangs from the rotor like a pendulum.
The mast and gearbox do not have to be as strong and so can be lighter, an important
consideration in early machines where power was limited. The Sikorsky R-4 had a
three-blade head with zero-offset as shown in Figure 4.10.
Figure 2.9 showed the result in the hover if the centre of gravity of the hull does not
coincide with the mast. The tip path plane remains horizontal, as the lift vector must
be vertical, but the articulation must act like a universal joint so that the mast can tilt
with respect to the tip path plane until the centre of gravity is below the centre of the
rotor head.
The zero offset rotor head needs to be mounted on top of a relatively tall mast to
obtain a reasonable range of CM positions without undue changes in hull attitude. It
may be necessary to shift balance weights if the number of passengers is changed, and
the fuel tanks will have to be located on the CM.
Figure 4.11(a) shows that the teetering rotor is a special case of a two-bladed zerooffset articulated rotor where the two blades are rigidly attached to one another (except
for the feathering bearings) and share a common articulation bearing. Both Bell and
Hiller have produced a number of machines using teetering rotors. Bending stresses due
to coning are reduced in the teetering rotor by attaching the blades at the typical coning
angle. As the coning of the blades raises the centre of mass of the rotor, the teetering

bearing is then raised above the feathering axes at the hub so that it is essentially at the
rotor CM. There will then be less vibration when the tip path axis is not parallel with
the shaft axis. The result is called an underslung rotor shown in Figure 4.11(b). As the
rotor head itself tilts to stay in the plane of the rotor disc, the effect of Figure 4.5 cannot
occur and so dragging hinges are not needed to overcome it. Forces due to varying drag
in translational ﬂight are resisted by blade stiffness.
The rigid connection between the blades means that their dragging frequency will be
very high. It will be seen in section 4.17 that this means no drag dampers are required.
The undercarriage needs no damping to prevent ground resonance and can be a simple
tubular skid arrangement. This further reduces the weight of the machine.
Two-bladed rotors have a disadvantage that both of the blades simultaneously enter
a lift trough in forward ﬂight at 90◦ and 270◦ of rotation. This causes a twice-perrevolution hop (two-per) at the hull. Later teetering rotors incorporated a degree of
ﬂapping ﬂexibility in the rotor head to decouple the hop from the hull. This is shown
in section 4.20.
At speed the hull of a zero-offset machine tends to blow back because the drag D
is applied a moment arm c below the suspension point as shown in Figure 4.12. At
speed, the tail plane will have to apply a download T at moment arm b to counter the
blowback. As a result the shaft and tip path axes nearly coincide. In a machine with an
articulated or ﬂexural head the hinge offset will generate a restoring couple if the hull
is blown back so a less powerful tail plane is sufﬁcient.

4.10 Dangers of zero-offset heads – negative g
The main advantage of the zero-offset rotor head is that no moments can be transferred
to the mast from the blades and so the mast can be very light. The absence of dragging

Rotors in practice 131

b×T=c×D

Fig. 4.12 With a zero-offset head, blowback in forward ﬂight must be opposed by a down force from the
tail plane.

and undercarriage dampers allows a further weight saving. However, it is vital that
the machine is never placed in a ﬂight condition where the rotor thrust is downwards,
because in this negative-g situation the hull attitude is unstable, like a pencil balanced
on its point.
In the worst case the hull can roll so that the limit of travel of the teetering or ﬂapping
hinge is reached. The side thrust from the tail rotor can initiate such a roll. The resultant
pounding of the limit stops can break the mast. In zero or negative g the rotor will
cone ﬂat or downwards raising the possibility that if the hull pitches the tail boom can
swing into the rotor disc.
A number of Robinson helicopters have been lost due to these effects, although the
manufacturer stresses the avoidance of manoeuvres such as pushovers that can induce
the negative-g condition. In the event of getting a zero-offset helicopter into negative
g, there is only one solution and that is to return lift to the blades. This can be achieved
by the application of back cyclic or raised collective or both.
In some zero-offset helicopters, such as the Bell 222, a strong spring is ﬁtted to the
teetering axis that minimizes the negative-g instability, but it does require a stronger
mast and gearbox to withstand the spring forces.
Zero-offset heads will not tolerate a wide range of CM movement in any direction
and are more prone to blade sailing when starting in high winds.

4.11 Rotor response
Different rotor head designs respond to cyclic control inputs in different ways
contrasted in Figure 4.13.
Consider a two-bladed rotor where the pitch control rods are at 90◦ to the blades. For
example, if the swashplate is tilted down at the front, the pitch angle of the blade moving
forwards will be reduced, and the pitch angle of the opposite blade will be increased.
This will cause a lift moment difference that results in a rolling couple. However, the
gyroscope-like phase lag of the rotor will convert this into a pitch forward, so the front
of the rotor disc will drop. In the hover, if the rotor is articulated, it will continue to
pitch forward until it is parallel with the swashplate. At this point there will be no more

cyclic variation of the blade pitch angle, and so the rotor will remain at this angle. The
tip path plane tries to stay parallel to the swashplate. This is known as following, and
the speed with which the rotor follows the swashplate is known as the following rate.
The following rate depends on the relationship between the aerodynamic forces trying
to tilt the disc and the inertial forces trying to oppose the tilt. The aeromechanical
parameter that is used to quantify the phenomenon is called the Lock number.
For a given rotor, the following rate is proportional to the RPM and the air density. Operation at high density-altitude will result in the cyclic response reducing, and
changing in phase.
In practice the following rate is generally high enough that the rotor will respond
to a change of control axis within about a revolution. This does not mean that the
whole machine will respond in this way, which is just as well. There is a considerable
difference between the following rate and the response rate of the machine.

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 132 — #16

Rotors in practice 133

In a real helicopter, the rotor is not rigidly attached to the hull because of the presence
of ﬂapping hinges or ﬂexures. As the rotor disc tilts, the hull will lag behind so that the
tip path axis and the shaft axis do not coincide. This non-coincidence causes moments
and it is these that govern the tilt of the hull. As the hull tilts, it causes a further tilt
of the swashplate. This causes a further tilt of the rotor and so on. This is an example
of positive feedback. Consequently in practice a steady application of cyclic control
causes the rotor disc to tilt at constant speed. The ratio between the two is the response
rate. The stiffer the connection between the rotor and the mast, the more the rotor is
able to tilt the hull and swashplate, and so the greater is the positive feedback and the
greater the response rate for a given cyclic application.
In general the stiffer the rotor head, the more rapid the response rate will be. Before
the mechanism was understood, some experimental helicopters had response rates
beyond the ability of the pilot and were uncontrollable. The use of hinged rotor heads
in early helicopters had the advantage of reducing the response rate to what the pilot
could manage.
The case of a machine that is initially hovering in equilibrium will be considered.
In the zero-offset head, the application of a cyclic input causes the tip path plane to
tilt with respect to the mast. As a result the thrust vector no longer passes through
the CM, and a roll couple is created as shown in Figure 4.13(a). This will be proportional to the height of the rotor above the CM, and is a further reason for tall masts
on teetering machines. The tip path plane initially tilts without the mast following
it. Since the cyclic pitch control operates with respect to the mast axis, tip path tilt
opposes the cyclic pitch control, so the further the disc tilts with respect to the mast,
the less cyclic pitch change the blades get. Excessive following rate is thus prevented.
As the teetering head cannot exert a couple on the mast, it can only pitch or roll the
hull if the rotor thrust is tilted. If the rotor thrust is reduced for any reason, the cyclic
control becomes less effective. This may happen in a pushover manoeuvre. The rotor
disc will follow the cyclic control, but the hull doesn’t follow the disc. Such a situation may result in mast or droop stop pounding and all pilots who want to live will
avoid it.
In the case of an articulated rotor head with offset ﬂapping bearings, the tip path
plane tilts as before, and moves the thrust vector with respect to the CM as before, but
in addition the blade tensions no longer align and this results in a roll couple being
applied to the rotor head as shown in Figure 4.13(b). The further apart the ﬂapping
bearings are, the more powerful this effect will be, speeding up the following rate.
Consider a fully articulated head with torsion springs ﬁtted to the ﬂapping and
dragging axes. If the springs are stiff, there will be little deﬂection of the bearings.
Deﬂection will be transferred to the blades and they will ﬂex. If the springs are weak,
there will be little to prevent deﬂection of the bearings, and bending loads on the
blades are minimized. Clearly the ﬂexural rotor head (c) can behave more or less like
an articulated head depending on the stiffness of the ﬂexures. The stiffness of the ﬂexures
may be different in the ﬂapping and dragging directions. Sections 4.16 and 4.17 will
explore the effects of dragging stiffness.
In the ﬂexural rotor head, a single structural element often acts both as a bearing
and as a spring. It will bend, but not without an applied moment, and so ﬂapping and
dragging are allowed by a combination of rotor head and blade ﬂexing. The distribution
of bending is clearly a function of the relative stiffness. All other things being equal, in
an articulated head the ﬂapping hinge offset determines the magnitude of the couple
applied to the mast when the tip path axis deviates from the mast axis, whereas in
a hingeless head this couple is determined by the stiffness of the system. In order to
simplify analysis of the dynamics of a helicopter having a hingeless head, it is possible

134 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 4.14 In a hingeless rotor, the same couple could be produced by a rotor with ﬂapping hinges having an
equivalent offset.

to describe the rotor by its effective or equivalent offset. Figure 4.14 shows that this is
the radius of a virtual ﬂapping hinge that would produce the same couple for the same
disc tilt.
In the hingeless rotor head the tip path plane will attempt to tilt as the result of a
cyclic control application, but the roll couple applied to the rotor head will depend
on the ﬂapping stiffness. Hingeless rotor machines with stiff ﬂapping ﬂexures can be
highly manoeuvrable, as the Westland Lynx regularly demonstrates. In fact a hingeless
rotor helicopter can be rigged to hover upside down as many model helicopter pilots
have demonstrated.
Whilst the stiff hingeless rotor head leads to an agile machine, it will impose heavy
bending loads on the blades and possibly also on the feathering bearings, which must
be designed accordingly. Unless carefully designed, such rotors can also respond so
rapidly to cyclic inputs that control is difﬁcult. A permanently operating gyrostabilizer
may be needed.
In hingeless rotors with stiff ﬂapping ﬂexures, the thrust vector offset with respect
to the CM is much less important, and the mast does not need to be so tall, although
machines with very short masts have suffered from powerful canopy vibration due to
the non-uniform rotor downwash. Stiff rotors can withstand a wider range of CM
travel because a rotor head couple can be used to keep the hull in the correct attitude,
being limited by stresses in the mast and its bearings.
The stiff hingeless rotor is the goal for the ultimate in manoeuvrability, at the cost of a
rougher ride and the need for a stronger mast and airframe. A more compliant hingeless
rotor head allows a more cost effective solution and a better ride. The bearings of the
articulated head are replaced by elements that can ﬂex and thus need no lubrication
or maintenance. It is not inconceivable that ﬂexural heads will be developed which
will last the life of the machine. Given the high maintenance costs of helicopters, any
development that tangibly reduces wear and maintenance is highly signiﬁcant.

4.12 Feathering
Despite the enormous pull of the blades, it must be possible to rotate them on their
feathering axes in order to control the pitch angle. There are several approaches to the
problem of the feathering bearing and these are contrasted in Figure 4.15.
Raoul Hafner ﬁrst used a torsion bar shown at (a) to eliminate the axial thrust in the
feathering bearing so that the remaining bearing became essentially a locating sleeve. It
is a characteristic of bending and torsion that the greatest stress is caused at the surface

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 134 — #18

so the interior of thick components is unstressed. This is why tubes are used instead of
solid bars. A given cross-section of material will be more rugged if it is divided up into
many slim elements in parallel and in addition will be easier to twist. This division into
many elements also gives a degree of protection against failure because some elements
can fail without the whole assembly failing.
The blade may be attached by laminated steel shims shown at (b) which can twist as
the pitch is changed. PTFE tape may be placed between the shims to allow one to slide
over the next. A variation in the idea is used by Bell on the JetRanger. Here the tensile
element is a strap made from hundreds of strands of steel wire (c) like the cable in a
suspension bridge. The blade is guided by a sleeve bearing that only takes bending loads.

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 135 — #19

136 The Art of the Helicopter
Enstrom use an elastomer in compression to retain the blade. Elastomers are virtually
incompressible but ﬂexible synthetic compounds. Figure 4.15(d) shows that if a block
of elastomer is placed under compressive stress, it will bulge at the sides. If the bulging is
serious, the strength of the material will be exceeded and it will tear. Bulging would also
allow the blades to move away from the mast, causing balance problems. Figure 4.15(e)
shows that this problem is overcome by interleaving thin shims of metal with layers of
elastomer. The metal shims prevent bulging under compression, but have little effect on
the ability of the unit to twist so that pitch changes can be made. As the diagram shows
at (f ), the blade is guided by sleeve bearings, but the elastomer takes the thrust. Note
that the system is failsafe because the bearing is in compression. Even if the bearing
begins to disintegrate, the blade cannot come off.
In the Enstrom only the feathering axis is elastomeric. Aerospatiale pioneered a
spherical elastomeric laminated bearing which allows full articulation in addition to
feathering.

4.13 Pitch control
There are a number of mechanisms suitable for pitch control. No two designs have
exactly the same control linkages, but the diagrams here are representative of actual
practice. One of the best ways of appreciating how these systems work is to have
someone move the controls of a helicopter one at a time whilst observing how the
linkages move.
The most common control system is the sliding swashplate shown in Figure 4.16(a).
The swashplate is made in two halves. The lower part is ﬁtted with a spherical bearing
so that the swashplate can tilt to any angle in any direction. The sphere can also slide
up and down, often on the outside of the gearbox. A large diameter ball race is ﬁtted
between the two halves of the swashplate. A pair of jointed scissors links is ﬁtted. One
of these ensures that the lower half of the swashplate cannot revolve and the other
ensures that the upper part turns with the rotor shaft. Each rotor blade grip is ﬁtted
with a pitch-operating arm. The end of each arm is connected to the periphery of the
swashplate by a pushrod ﬁtted with spherical bearings.
Movement of the collective lever raises or lowers the swashplate, and this causes all
of the pitch operating arms to rotate all of the blades about their feathering axes by
the same amount. In addition, movement of the cyclic stick in two axes causes the
swashplate to tilt in two axes. Simultaneous lifting and tilting of the swashplate by two
controls requires a device called a mixer, an example of which is shown in Figure 4.16(b).
One end of the mixing lever is pivoted on the helicopter frame or on the gearbox and
is connected to the collective lever by a rod. The opposite end is ﬁtted with a bell
crank operated by one axis of the cyclic control. The cyclic pitch changes take place
differentially around the average pitch determined by the collective setting.
Figure 4.16(b) shows only one dimension of the cyclic mixing for clarity. In practice
the cyclic control works in two axes and two bell cranks are ﬁtted to the mixing lever.
These bell cranks are connected to the swashplate by vertical rods and to the cyclic stick
by horizontal rods. Moving the collective lever moves both bell cranks bodily up and
down together, and so the swashplate rises and falls. Moving the cyclic stick rocks the
bell cranks and tilts the swashplate about the collective setting in any desired direction.
Figure 4.17 shows an alternative arrangement known as a spider. The spider has
radial spokes, one for each blade. Pushrods connect the ends of the spokes to the pitch
operating arms. The hub of the spider is spherical so it can tilt and slide within the
shaft and it is ﬁtted with a vertical post passing down through the centre of the shaft

and protruding below the gearbox. The lower end of the post is moved up and down
to obtain collective pitch changes and from side to side in two axes to obtain cyclic
pitch control. Figure 4.17 shows an installation in which the radial arms pass through
slots in the rotor shaft. Such a system is used in the Lynx where a signiﬁcant part of
the control system is protected inside the rotor head. In the spider system, jointed rods
approach the bottom end of the spider post in three axes, and tilt and lift the spider.

138 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 4.17 A spider installation in which vertical movement of the spider controls collective pitch, whereas
tilting the spider applies cyclic pitch. In this example the arms of the spider emerge through slots in the rotor
shaft. In some cases the spider emerges from the top of the rotor shaft.

The Enstrom has a control linkage in which the pitch control rods pass up the centre
of the rotor shaft to give an extremely neat external appearance and reduced drag.
Figure 4.18 shows that the rotor head is ﬁtted with rocker arms to transfer pushrod
motion to the pitch operating arms. The pushrods are connected to a miniature spider
located below the gearbox. The spider itself swivels on a universal joint so it can tilt in
two axes whilst turning with the rotor. The spider support slides up and down in the
rotor shaft under the control of a fork on the collective crank. The cyclic control rods
tilt the spider to obtain cyclic pitch variation about the average collective setting.
Figure 4.19 shows the principle of servo tabs. Instead of attempting to change the
blade pitch at the root, the blade is ﬁtted with a small aerodynamic control surface
rather like a miniature tail plane, typically at about 75% of rotor radius. Pushrods
inside the blade allow the angle of the servo tab to be controlled. Servo tab systems
have the advantage that the pilot only has to move the tab; the blade is moved by
aerodynamic force on the tab. As a result power assistance is not necessary. The blade
shank is made ﬂexible to allow the tab to twist it. As the pitch control force is provided
directly to the blade at an outboard location, there are structural and ﬂutter resistance
advantages. Servo tabs have been used extensively in the various models produced by
Kaman, and are extremely effective. It is not clear why they have not been more popular
elsewhere.
In a zero-offset rotor head such as the one shown in Figure 4.16, the rotor has a
phase lag of 90◦ and to compensate, the pitch operating arms have an advance angle
of 90◦ . In this case, the swashplate tilts in two axes exactly as the cyclic stick does and

the axis about which the swashplate turns is the control axis. In fact the control cranks
could be designed so that the swashplate stays parallel to the cyclic stick.
In multi-bladed heads this situation is seldom found. Such heads will be articulated
or ﬂexural and their ﬂapping frequency will not be identical to the rotational frequency.
As a result their phase lag will not be precisely 90◦ and the control system will need to
compensate by arranging to tilt the swashplate in a slightly different direction to the
cyclic stick.
Although an advance angle of 90◦ is easily obtained in a two-bladed teetering rotor,
with articulated heads it becomes impossible because the end of the pitch-operating
arm must terminate on the ﬂapping axis to avoid the δ3 effect (see Figure 4.9(b)). In
multi-blade heads the end of the pitch-operating arm must remain clear of the next
blade root. When the advance angle of the pitch operating arms is less than 90◦ , this is
corrected by advancing the stationary part of the swashplate. Figure 4.20 shows that

advance. In a head with a phase lag of less than 90◦ , the swashplate advance could be reduced to compensate.

the pushrods from the cockpit must now connect at different angles. By consensus,
all rotational angles are measured in degrees from the tail boom in the direction of
rotation as shown.
The control axis can stay parallel to the cyclic stick, but the axis of the swashplate
will tilt with a phase shift with respect to both. For example, a four-bladed head may
have an advance angle of only 45◦ . The swashplate tilt will need to be advanced a
further 45◦ with respect to the cyclic stick. Pushing the stick forward would cause the
swashplate to tilt down midway between the front and the advancing side, i.e. at a phase
angle of 135◦ , so the lowest point on the control orbit is reached 45◦ before the straight
ahead position. At this point the pushrod going straight up to the pitch-operating
arm will set the advancing blade at 90◦ to minimum pitch. The same blade will reach
maximum pitch 180◦ later, and so there will be a roll couple towards the advancing
side. The phase lag of the rotor will convert this to a forward tilt.
In other words the swashplate linkage has advanced the stick movement with respect
to the control axis by 45◦ , the pitch-operating arms have advanced it a further 45◦ , and
the 90◦ rotor lag cancels both, making the rotor tilt to follow the cyclic stick. Inspection
of the cyclic pushrods in the Enstrom or the Lynx will show that they approach the
spider at 45◦ either side of the centreline. The pitch-operating arms have an advance
of a further 45◦ . The Chinook, having three-bladed heads, has an advance angle of
60◦ . In contrast the JetRanger, having only two blades, can have an advance angle
of 90◦ in the pitch operating arms, and the swashplate moves parallel to the control
axis. Since the advance angle of the pitch-operating arms and the phase advance of the

Rotors in practice 141

swashplate always add up to the phase lag of the rotor, they can generally be ignored
for the purpose of studying rotor response, and all that is of interest is the control axis.
The direction of main rotor rotation is quite unimportant. On most American
machines the blades rotate anticlockwise when viewed from above, whereas most
French and Russian machines use the opposite rotation.

4.14 Cyclic trim
The controls of a ﬁxed-wing aircraft tend to be blown to the neutral position by the
slipstream, and this results in the pilot feeling resistance roughly proportional to control
deﬂection. This feel is important so the pilot knows how much control power he is using.
In the helicopter, there is no equivalent of feel in the cyclic control. Forces fed back to
the cyclic stick from the rotor head bear little relationship to the deﬂection, so feel must
be provided artiﬁcially. This is done by springs that tend to return the cyclic control to
a central position.
The cyclic displacement needed in translational ﬂight to counteract lift dissymmetry
and inﬂow roll would be tiring to maintain against spring pressure, so a trim system is
used to alter the neutral position of the springs. Figure 4.21 shows how a trim servo
works. The trim servo has telescopic cylinders containing strong springs that normally

electric motor 1 which drives a worm 2, a wheel 3 and a leadscrew 4. If the pilot moves the stick away from
the trim servo, sleeve 5 and rod 7 move together, compressing spring 6. In the opposite direction, spring 8
compresses and sleeve 5 remains stationary. (b) Circuit of trim motor drive. The motor direction is selected by
choice of ﬁeld coils which are wound in opposite senses.

142 The Art of the Helicopter
hold the telescopic elements at their end stops. Control movement will compress one
or other of the springs to give feel. The neutral position of the springs can be adjusted
by an electric motor operating a screw jack. One trim motor is ﬁtted to each cyclic
axis. The motors are controlled using a small four-way switch mounted on the cyclic
stick where it can easily be reached by the pilot’s thumb. The switch is simply moved in
the same direction the pilot is pulling the stick to hold the desired attitude. The force
needed to hold the stick will be felt to reduce as the trim motor runs. Limit switches
prevent the trim motor running too far and jamming.
As an alternative to trim motors, the centring springs may be attached to the hull
reference by magnetic clutches. These are normally engaged by permanent magnets
and the application of current in a coil can cause them to release. If the pilot holds the
stick in the desired position and brieﬂy applies the trim release current, the springs will
extend to their neutral position and when the clutches grip again, the cyclic stick will
be held in the trimmed attitude. The force trim release button will be on the handle of
the cyclic stick.

4.15 Tilting heads
The equivalence of ﬂapping and feathering was introduced in section 4.3. A rotor
ﬂapping with respect to the control axis is feathering with respect to the tip path axis.
Figure 4.22 shows that this principle can be used for cyclic control. If the head has
ﬂapping hinges, it can be tilted with respect to the tip path axis. The result is that
the blades are now cyclically feathered and the rotor will try to roll to a new attitude
where the ﬂapping and feathering cease. In the hover it will be able to do so, but in

Fig. 4.22 Tilting head control. If the blades have ﬂapping hinges (a), they can remain in-plane whilst the head
tilts, (b). Head tilt applies cyclic pitch causing the rotor to follow the attitude of the head (c) (which is the control
axis).

Fig. 4.23 A ﬁxed-pitch tilting head needs no more than a gimbal and control rods leading to the cockpit.

translational ﬂight a steady application of cyclic feathering is required to overcome lift
asymmetry.
Early de la Cierva autogyros had aircraft-style control surfaces and no rotor control at
all. The rotor was equipped only with ﬂapping hinges. In forward ﬂight, lift asymmetry
would result in extra lift on the advancing side, but this would precess to an aft tilt of
the disc. Figure 1.10 showed that the thrust of the airscrew overcomes the rearward
component of rotor thrust due to the aft tilt. As the attitude of the hull does not
change when the rotor tilts aft, the mast is now tilted forwards with respect to the tip
path plane. The result is that the rotor has cyclic pitch applied. In an autogyro of this
kind the rotor will ﬂap back until the correct amount of cyclic pitch is obtained for
the airspeed. Whilst the autogyro ﬂies in this way, it should be emphasized that the
helicopter cannot and does not.
In later de la Cierva machines, the aircraft control surfaces were dispensed with and
the pilot could tilt the rotor head for pitch and roll. This approach is used to this day for
control of lightweight ﬁxed-pitch autogyros. Where there is no shaft drive or collective
control, the rotor head can be very simple, as shown in Figure 4.23. The rotor requires
just a teetering hinge and the head is mounted on a gimbal so the pilot can tilt it. The
tilting head can only apply cyclic pitch. Where collective control is required, a feathering
bearing will be needed and so the tilting head has no advantage. Hafner was the ﬁrst
to build an autogyro with cyclic and collective control and the mechanical solutions he
devised would be used in his subsequent and successful Sycamore helicopter.

4.16 Dragging dynamics
In-plane blade motion is variously called ‘lead lag’, ‘lag’ or ‘dragging’. This author
prefers the term dragging because lead lag is cumbersome and lag can be confused with
phase lag; another thing altogether. Section 4.6 illustrated the mechanisms responsible
for dragging. In many rotor designs, dragging hinges or ﬂexible members are provided

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 143 — #27

144 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 4.24 When a blade drags, the CM moves closer to the rotor axis. In rotating co-ordinates, centrifugal
force creates a restoring moment proportional to deﬂection such that the blade has a resonant response to
excitation in dragging. Unlike ﬂapping, the aerodynamic damping is low.

to reduce stress. In other designs, the rotor is designed to be extremely stiff, but as
stiffness is always ﬁnite, there will still be some dragging motion. In all cases the
dynamics of the system must be considered in order to avoid resonances.
In a traditional articulated rotor head, the dragging hinge cannot apply a restoring
moment to the blade. The only restoring force for dragging motion in this case is due to
rotation. Figure 4.24 shows that when a blade drags on a hinge having an offset from
the rotor axis, the CM of the blade moves closer to that axis. When the rotor is turning,
the CM will tend to be at the greatest possible radius and so if the blade drags forward
or back, there will be a restoring force. Figure 4.24 is drawn in a rotating frame of
reference in order to arrest the rotation. The acceleration of the blade is now zero and
has been replaced by an equivalent centrifugal force. It will be seen that the centrifugal
force, which must pass through the rotor axis, creates a small moment due to the drag
hinge offset.
The restoring moment is proportional to the deﬂection and the result is that a blade
which suffers an in-plane disturbance will tend to execute simple harmonic motion at its
resonant frequency. In an articulated rotor, resonant frequency is proportional to the
square root of the stiffness. The stiffness is due to centrifugal force and is proportional
to the square of the RRPM. Thus the dragging resonant frequency will be proportional
to RRPM as was the case for articulated ﬂapping. However, unlike ﬂapping, the only
aerodynamic damping available to the dragging motion is due to changes of proﬁle
drag. Damping will often need to be augmented by mechanical means.
In hingeless rotors there will be some degree of structural stiffness that will provide a
restoring force for the blade even when the rotor is not turning. The dragging resonant
behaviour of a rotor can be characterized by the Southwell coefﬁcients. Figure 4.25
shows how the ratio of dragging resonant frequency to rotor frequency is determined
by K 1 and K 2. K 1 reﬂects the resonant frequency when the rotor is not turning, as
determined by the blade inertia and the stiffness of the rotor/head system in the dragging
plane and is called the structural stiffening component. For an articulated head, K 1
is zero because the dragging hinge has no stiffness. K 2 is determined by the effective
or actual dragging hinge offset and represents what is usually called the centrifugal
stiffening component.
Figure 4.25(a) shows that in the articulated rotor, the hinge offset and consequent
restoring forces are generally small and so the dragging resonant frequency is a small
proportion of the rotor frequency, typically between 20 and 30%.
In a hingeless rotor, shown in Figure 4.25(b), at low RRPM the structural stiffness
will dominate, whereas at high RRPM rotational forces dominate and the dragging

Rotors in practice 145

Fig. 4.25 Blade dragging is characterized by Southwell’s coefﬁcients which describe the static and centrifugal
components of the restoring force. (a) In the articulated rotor, there is no static stiffness. The dragging frequency
is a fraction of the rotor frequency. (b) In the hingeless rotor there is static stiffness so there is a ﬁnite resonant
frequency even at zero RRPM. As RRPM increases, centrifugal stiffening dominates and the frequency becomes
asymptotic to what it would have been for a hinged blade with the same mass distribution.

frequency becomes asymptotic to what it would have been with no structural stiffness.
As a result the dragging frequency is no longer proportional to RRPM.
It should be appreciated that in the above discussion and in Figures 4.24 and 4.25 the
dragging frequency is with respect to the turning rotor, not with respect to stationary
co-ordinates. Frequencies experienced at the hull will be in stationary co-ordinates and
will be different from the frequency discussed here.

4.17 Ground resonance
Given the ﬂexible nature of rotors, it is possible for the centres of mass of the blades to
get ‘out-of-pattern’ as shown in Figure 4.26. This is the term describing the condition
where the blades are not evenly spaced around the disc. This may be due to an external
inﬂuence such as the impact of a run-on landing or starting the rotor on a slope. It may
also be self-excited.
Section 4.16 considered the resonant dragging motion of a single blade, whereas
in practice it is necessary to consider the phase relationship from blade to blade.
Figure 4.27 shows some possibilities for a three-bladed rotor. Rotors with more blades
will also behave in the same way except that there are more phases of blade motion. Twobladed rotors have different characteristics, but because such rotors seldom employ
dragging hinges these differences will not be enlarged here.
It must be stressed that throughout Figure 4.27 the diagrams are in rotating
co-ordinates so that the rotor appears to be stopped. Figure 4.27(a) shows the case
where, for example, a sudden increase in drive torque has caused all of the blades to
drag back by the same amount. They will all resonate in the same phase and the result
is that the CM of the rotor is undisturbed. Figure 4.27(b) shows the case where there is
a 120◦ phase difference between the motion of each blade. Now the centre of the rotor
hub is moving in a circle. The motion may be visualized by considering the operation
of a three-cylinder radial engine.

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 145 — #29

146 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 4.26 Out-of-pattern blades shift the CM of the rotor and whirl the top of the mast.

Figure 4.27(c) shows the same situation except that the phase relationship is −120◦ .
The hub is still moving in a circle, but in the opposite direction. There is a strong
analogy here with the three-phase electric motor that can be reversed by changing any
two connections. This circular motion is known as whirling and it may be forward, in
the same direction as the rotor, or backward, in the opposite sense to rotor direction.
Figure 4.27(d) shows the case where one blade is not dragging, but the other two are
dragging at 180◦ . Now the hub motion is linear.
If the effects of Figure 4.27 are considered in a non-rotating frame of reference,
(a) will have no effect. Effect (b) causes circular whirling at a frequency which is the
sum of the rotor frequency and the dragging resonant frequency, whereas (c) will result
in circular whirling at a frequency which is given by the rotor frequency minus the
dragging frequency. The whirling frequency seen by the hull has been modiﬁed by
the addition of the rotor frequency. If the whirling experienced by the hull is in the
same direction as the rotor turns, it is said to be progressive. If it is in the opposite
sense it is said to be regressive. The whirling orbit is reminiscent of some types of food
mixer. A mild form of such an orbit is usually experienced during rotor starting with
an articulated rotor and is called ‘padding’ by pilots.
In a real helicopter these whirling forces are applied to the top of the mast. The CM
of the hull is well below the rotor head, and the result is a combination of pitching and
lateral rocking. The moment of inertia of a helicopter about the pitching axis is quite
high owing to the long tail boom, but there is less inertia about the roll axis, so generally
lateral movement will dominate. The hull will not be inﬁnitely stiff and may also be
supported on a sprung undercarriage, and so it will have natural resonant frequencies
of rocking.

Fig. 4.27 Effects of dragging blade motion. (a) A sudden application of drive torque may result in all three
blades dragging in the same phase. (b) When the dragging of each blade is at 120◦ phase to the next, the hub
moves in a circle. (c) If the phase relationship of (b) is changed, the direction of whirling is reversed. (d) Where
two blades drag in anti-phase and one blade is stationary, the hub is driven in a line. Note that all of these
examples are in rotating co-ordinates.

In the absence of preventive measures, if a resonant frequency in the hull is the same
as that of a whirling frequency, one of two things can happen. Either the hull will act as
a vibration absorber as was described in section 3.27, and the whirling will be opposed,
or the rocking will become increasingly violent until the machine either comes apart or
turns on its side. The phenomenon was ﬁrst observed when a taxiing autogyro struck
a rock with a wheel and literally disintegrated.
Needless to say this Jekyll and Hyde behaviour in seemingly similar circumstances
means that the mechanism involved must be extremely subtle. Whilst the results of
ground resonance are painfully obvious, the mechanism causing it is not obvious at
all. Until a mathematical basis for the phenomenon was found, designers proceeded
empirically. For example, Frank Piasecki obtained an improvement on his ﬁrst
machine by ﬁlling the tyres with cork. It was concluded early that ground resonance
is purely a mechanical phenomenon and that aerodynamic forces are not signiﬁcant.
There are some parallels with whirling phenomena observed in other disciplines such
as steam turbines.

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 147 — #31

148 The Art of the Helicopter
The ﬁrst full mathematical treatment of ground resonance was due to Robert
Coleman and Arnold Feingold who were working at NACA (the forerunner of NASA).
The mathematics turned out to be so complicated that the authors had to present their
results in the form of charts intended to be practically useful without the reader needing to have advanced mathematical skills. Using these charts, designers were able to
tame ground resonance, but this is not the same thing as understanding it. In order
to understand ground resonance it is necessary to consider the geometry of whirling.
Initially this will be considered for the case of the rotor alone.
The rotor is assumed to be isolated, and turning without translating. There is no
external force on an isolated system so, according to Newton’s laws, the overall centre
of mass of the rotor cannot move. If the centre of mass of the hub is whirling, this must
mean that the blades together must have an effective centre of mass that is whirling in
the opposite direction. Figure 4.28, which is in rotating co-ordinates, shows the orbits
of various points on a blade and hub in a forwards whirling system. There will be a
null point on the blade between the drag hinge and the blade CM that is oscillating
radially but not tangentially. Note that the motion for a backwards whirling system
can be seen by reversing all of the circles and ellipses.
In whirling, the KE of the hub is constantly changing because the circular motion
requires a constant change of velocity. It follows that the kinetic energy of the blades
must also be changing constantly. The blade KE variation is due to motion of the blade
CM plus that due to in-plane rotation of the moment of inertia of the blade about the
null point. Essentially whirling is a continuous interplay of blade and hub energy and
in the absence of friction at the hinges and any aerodynamic effect it could continue
indeﬁnitely.
Figure 4.29 is in stationary co-ordinates. Figure 4.29(a) shows an articulated rotor
turning anticlockwise and whirling forwards whereas (b) shows the same rotor which is
still turning anticlockwise but which is whirling backwards. Let these rotors be ﬁtted to
a helicopter having a rocking hull resonance. In both cases the ﬁgure shows the blade at

Fig. 4.28 In an isolated whirling rotor, the overall kinetic energy must remain constant. Consequently there
must be an energy interchange between the blades and the hub. If the hub is whirling in one direction, the blade
CMs must be whirling in the opposite direction. The loci of several points in the whirling system are shown.

Fig. 4.29 (a) A rotor turning anticlockwise with forward whirling. The reaction from the hull opposes the

180◦ passing over the nose. In the case of (a), to obtain the rocking frequency seen by the
hull, the forward whirling frequency must be added to the rotor frequency. Clearly the
whirling is progressive. If the hull/undercarriage system is resonant at this frequency,
then it will produce a force opposing the rocking excitation because the response of the
hull at resonance must be anti-phase to the exciting motion as was shown in section 3.27.
This force is applied at the mast. It will be clear from Figure 4.29(a) that at the instant
depicted by the ﬁgure, the angle θ between hub and blade shank is increasing. The force
applied by the mast tends to reduce θ , thereby opposing the whirling. As a result, the
system is stable. Ground resonance cannot occur due to the higher whirling frequency
resulting from forward whirling.
In the case of Figure 4.29(b) the whirling is backward. To obtain the rocking frequency seen by the hull, the forward whirling frequency must be subtracted from the
rotor frequency. However, the whirling frequency is lower than the rotor frequency, so
the whirling seen by the hull is still progressive. If the hull has a rocking resonance at
this frequency, it will produce a force in anti-phase to the whirling as before. However,
it will be clear from Figure 4.29(b) that at the instant depicted by the ﬁgure, the angle
θ between hub and blade shank is decreasing. The force applied by the mast tends to
decrease θ further, thereby augmenting the whirling. As a result, the system is unstable.
Ground resonance occurs due to the lower whirling frequency resulting from backward
whirling.
In mechanical terms, the mechanical impedance of the system has become negative,
so that it can gain energy from forces that would otherwise oppose motion. Negative

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 149 — #33

150 The Art of the Helicopter
impedance is used in electronics to construct oscillators. The criterion for this to happen
is that the whirling must be both progressive and backwards. Given that the system is
unstable in this mode, an undamped rotor can spontaneously display ground resonance.
In the absence of preventive measures, a helicopter on the ground with progressive
backward rotor whirling is a mechanical oscillator. Given the huge amount of energy
stored in the rotor, once started the whirling will increase in amplitude until something
breaks. Hull rocking resonance can only occur if there is a reaction from the ground,
hence the name of the phenomenon. This also explains why a machine can ﬂy safely
but disintegrate on landing, as has happened on a number of occasions.
There are a number of solutions to ground resonance which will be explored. It will
be seen from a consideration of Figure 4.29 that damping any changes in the angle θ will
be highly effective hence the use of dragging dampers in the traditional fully articulated
rotor head. In many cases damping is provided in the undercarriage to dissipate landing
impacts and this damping can augment but not replace the damping in the head.
In modern helicopters employing damping, ground resonance is virtually unknown
provided the dampers are kept in good order. These dampers may be hydraulic, similar
to automobile dampers, which work by forcing oil through a small oriﬁce, or elastomeric, which work by dissipating heat in hysteretic ﬂexing. The latter have the advantage of needing no maintenance. Oil ﬁlled dampers will lose effectiveness if the oil leaks.
Given the destructive nature of ground resonance, it is a good idea to examine the
dampers as part of the pre-ﬂight inspection. By moving the blade on its dragging
hinge, the resistance of the damper can be felt and the oil can be heard rushing through
the damping oriﬁce. All of the blades should feel and sound the same. If one blade
feels different the damper may have some air in it. As the air is forced through the
damping oriﬁce the sound will change. Whilst one weak damper may not cause ground
resonance, it may result in an increase in vibration in forward ﬂight. It is also useful to
learn the characteristics of the machine’s padding on start-up. If the rotor dampers are
satisfactory, but there is unusual padding, the undercarriage oleos may need attention.
A smoother rotor start may result if all of the blades are ﬁrst moved to their rearward
damper travel limit. Unusual padding may also result if the machine is parked on a slope
when gravity will tend to take the blades out of pattern during the early stages of starting.
Figure 4.30 shows an interference diagram or Coleman diagram for an articulated
rotor. K 1 = 0 and the dragging frequency is small in relation to the rotor speed. Thus
the rotor speed always overcomes the backward whirling and so all of the frequencies

Fig. 4.30 An interference diagram for an articulated rotor. The dragging frequencies fan out above and below
the rotor frequency. Both are progressive but one is backward.

Rotors in practice 151

concerned are positive. It was seen above that the dragging resonant frequency is
proportional to rotor frequency. Thus as rotor frequency increases, the upper and
lower whirling frequencies will be found symmetrically above and below rotor frequency. The horizontal line in the ﬁgure is the rocking resonant frequency of the hull.
As such a rotor is started from rest, there will ﬁrst be random padding due to the initial
blade orientation. At a rotor frequency corresponding to point A, the upper whirling
frequency coincides with the hull frequency. As the upper whirling coincidences are
always stable, the hull acts as a vibration absorber and this will be noted as a lull in the
padding. If the padding motion is noted, it will be seen to reverse phase after point A
because the system has passed through a resonance.
Further increase in speed makes the rotor frequency coincide with the hull frequency at B. Only if there is any mechanical imbalance in the rotor (a defect) will
there be any response. Further increase in rotor speed results in coincidence between
the hull frequency and the lower (backwards) whirling frequency. This is the coincidence responsible for ground resonance and the dampers will be working to prevent
it. The padding may be worse at this rotor speed. Flight RRPM will be above C where
rotation should be smooth.
A ‘soft-in-plane’ rotor has no dragging hinges, but a relatively compliant blade root
or hub so that there is a small restoring force even when the rotor is stationary. Consequently the dragging resonant frequency starts at a minimum value and increases
with RRPM. Figure 4.31 shows that when this characteristic is added to the rotor frequency, the forward whirling is always progressive and the frequency increases from
the static value to become asymptotic to the value determined by centrifugal stiffening.
Points A and B are stable as for the articulated rotor. However, the backwards whirling
frequency is initially higher than the rotor frequency. The whirling is actually in the
opposite direction to the rotor and so is regressive. If this regressive whirling coincides
with a hull frequency, the result is stable because the criterion for ground resonance is
not met. In regressive backwards whirling the whirling is backwards in both rotating
and stationary co-ordinates and the phase reversal needed for instability is absent.
However, when the rotor frequency in Figure 4.31 becomes equal to the backwards
whirling frequency at C, the whirling frequency becomes zero. At any higher rotor frequency the rotor frequency exceeds the whirling frequency and the backwards whirling

Fig. 4.31 A soft-in-plane rotor has a regressive dragging region as far as point C at low RRPM, but this is not
unstable.

damping is then needed.

becomes progressive again. The frequency then rises to become asymptotic to the
value determined by centrifugal stiffening. Point D in Figure 4.31 corresponds to a
coincidence between a hull frequency and a progressive backwards whirling frequency,
at which ground resonance can occur. Consequently soft-in-plane rotors still require
damping.
A ‘stiff-in-plane’ or ‘supercritical’ rotor has a powerful dragging restoring force due to
its construction and so has a signiﬁcant dragging resonant frequency, even at rest. When
the rotor is turning, the dragging frequency increases even further due to centrifugal
stiffening. Figure 4.32 shows that, by deﬁnition, in the case of a ‘stiff-in-plane’ rotor,
the whirling frequency is always higher than the rotor frequency. The behaviour of the
forward whirling is benign as before. However, as the backwards whirling frequency is
so high, the rotor frequency can never reverse it and so backwards whirling is always
regressive in the case of a stiff-in-plane rotor. In that case the unstable combination of
progressive backwards whirling can never occur and such a rotor can function with no
damping at all. Two-bladed teetering rotors take advantage of this concept. They are
built without dragging hinges to obtain supercritical dragging behaviour.
There is a small possibility of a damper failure and so it is as well to know how to
handle it. There are two ways to recover from incipient ground resonance, depending
on the rotor speed at the time it happens. If sufﬁcient revs are available to permit ﬂight,
the answer is to take-off immediately. With no ground reaction against the undercarriage, the hull rocking resonance cannot occur and the shaking stops immediately. An
attempt at a gentle landing may succeed, but if not then a landing should be attempted
on a soft or high friction surface which is more likely to absorb energy than tarmac.
It is important that there is no groundspeed whatsoever at the moment of touchdown.
If insufﬁcient rotor revs exist for ﬂight, the solution is to change the frequency of the
excitation away from the hull/undercarriage resonance. This may be done by reducing
rotor speed by cutting the throttle and using the rotor brake if ﬁtted.

4.18 Air resonance
Air resonance is a condition primarily relevant to helicopters having hingeless rotors.
In articulated rotors the natural frequency of the blade about the lagging hinge is low

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 152 — #36

Rotors in practice 153

and lag dampers are in any case present to prevent ground resonance. Furthermore the
motion of the hull is decoupled to some extent by the articulation. In a hingeless rotor
the blades lag by ﬂexing and the stiffness is higher, leading to a higher natural frequency
of lagging motion. The relatively stiff connection between the rotor and the hull means
that large rotor moments can excite hull ﬂexing. If such hull ﬂexing is resonant then an
unstable system could exist. A bending mode of the hull could result in a lateral motion
at the rotor head that is similar to the rocking experienced in ground resonance.
It should be appreciated that resonance may also be excited by the tail rotor. This
will be discussed in Chapter 5.

4.19 Dynamic rollover
Dynamic rollover is a hazard that can only occur when a helicopter is in contact with
the ground in some way. Normally the cyclic control has complete authority over the
attitude of the helicopter, but interference from the ground or from external loads can
reduce or even overcome the cyclic authority. Section 4.15 introduced the tilting hub
mechanism for cyclic control. If the hull of a helicopter is forcibly tilted, the rotor
will follow. Dynamic rollover occurs when external tilting forces overpower the cyclic
control. Teetering or zero-offset rotors are more prone than offset or hingeless rotors
because their cyclic authority is small to begin with.
Dynamic rollover becomes a possibility when the conditions on one side of the hull
are different from those on the other side. This may be due to an attempt to land or
take-off from a slope, an underslung load snagging a skid or a skid being stuck in mud
or the surface tension of wet sand. Most winches for personnel recovery are ﬁtted at
one side of the machine and if a winch rope snags on the ground it can cause difﬁculty.
A side wind and the thrust of the tail rotor complicate the matter.
Figure 4.33(a) shows what can happen with a stuck skid. The pilot raises the collective
lever to lift off, but the stuck skid combines with the rotor thrust to produce a roll couple
that could exceed the power of the cyclic control. In many cases the machine will be on
its side before the pilot can react and the cyclic authority becomes academic. The roll
accelerates because as the hull tips it increases the cyclic input to the rotor and causes
further roll. A variation of this hazard is where the stuck skid suddenly comes free and
the machine ends up on its other side because the pilot does not remove the lateral
cyclic quickly enough.
Figure 4.33(b) shows a helicopter about to lift a slung load. Unknown to the pilot the
load strap has snagged a skid. As the machine rises, once more the rotor thrust and
the load strap tension create a couple on the hull and the dynamic rollover takes place.
Most helicopter winches are installed with a view to bringing loads alongside one of
the hull doors. The load is applied with a considerable moment arm from the machine
CM. Moments due to normal loads can be resisted by the rotor, but in the event that
the winch line became snagged an attempt to climb would result in dynamic rollover.
This is one of the reasons why the pilot is provided with means to jettison loads in an
emergency. Underslung loads can be jettisoned by releasing the load hook that may
be electrically operated. Winches are ﬁtted with cable cutters that may be explosively
actuated.
Figure 4.33(c) shows an attempted landing on a slope. After the ﬁrst skid has touched,
the machine rotates about that skid. As it comes down, the control axis must be kept
vertical by the application of cyclic control. The question is, what happens when the
cyclic reaches the end of its travel and the other skid still is not in contact? The rotor
disc cannot be kept horizontal and there is a danger of dynamic rollover. If the landing

is continued, the hull will roll and carry the rotor with it due to the tilting head effect.
When the downhill skid contacts, there may be enough roll momentum that the roll
continues, with the uphill skid lifting. Once the CM of the machine is outside the skid
base there is no recovery. This explanation is the origin of the slope landing limit laid
down for each type of machine. These ﬁgures should be ignored at one’s peril.
Slope landings can be made harder or easier by wind. Figure 4.33(d) shows the wind
blowing upslope. This is an advantage because more cyclic travel is available. However,
if the wind subsequently reverses, it may become impossible to take-off because insufﬁcient cyclic travel exists to tilt the disc into wind when the mast is tilted downwind. An
experienced pilot might perform a ‘hop’ take-off which consists of bringing the rotor to
ﬂight RPM with neutral cyclic and then pulling collective rapidly to exit at a right angle
to the slope. Once the gear is clear of the ground full cyclic authority becomes available.
The preferred technique in all external load handling or slope landing situations is
to proceed very slowly, and if the cyclic travel approaches the limits the manoeuvre
will have to be halted. This means in the event of attempting a take-off, rotor thrust
should be applied very gradually so that any roll does not proceed too far. If anything
goes wrong, the collective should be lowered. With the rotor thrust gone, the couple

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 154 — #38

Rotors in practice 155

disappears and the machine should fall back onto its gear. In the event of a sloping
landing, if the cyclic stick travel is becoming extreme, the landing should be rejected.
The collective lever is pulled up to get the uphill skid off the ground. Again the couple
is eliminated because there is no ground reaction. Even if the roll has started, a smart
and powerful application of collective will recover cyclic control as soon as the skid
leaves the ground.
Rollover is also possible in a hingeless rotor machine if the cyclic control is not
trimmed to neutral before collective is raised to take-off, although the mechanism is
not the same as that of dynamic rollover. Pilots like to tilt the disc around on the ground
to check the cyclic controls before ﬂight. Hingeless rotor machines can have extremely
high cyclic power without much rotor tilt being present. The amount of tilt that would
be safe in an articulated machine might roll over a hingeless machine. Sometimes the
undercarriage squat or ground contact switch may be used to limit cyclic authority
when the machine is on the ground.

4.20 Some rotor head examples
The number of approaches used in rotor head design over the years has been subject to
wide variation. In the earliest days the theory of rotor dynamics was not well established
and most designs mixed theory with empiricism. As understanding increased, attention
turned ﬁrst to optimization of design for a particular purpose and subsequently to such
reﬁnements as the reduction of vibration and of build and maintenance cost.
Figure 4.34 shows the evolution of zero-offset heads. These are usually underslung so
that the hinge pin passes through the CM of the coned rotor. Supporting the rotor at its
CM allows the blades to conserve momentum as the disc tilts and dragging hinges can
be eliminated. This means that the rotor can be made supercritical in dragging. Ground
resonance cannot occur and no damping is needed in the head or in the landing gear.
This allows a cost and weight saving in small machines.
At (a) is the fully gimballed teetering head which essentially contains a Hooke joint
so that the rotor can tilt in any direction with respect to the mast. The blade grips
are mounted on feathering hinges. The feathering axis is parallel to one of the gimbal
axes and the attitude of the hub in that axis would be indeterminate were it not for an
equalizing linkage that makes the pitch of each blade equal with respect to the hub.
This type of head was used on early Bell and Hiller machines.
At (b) is the later type of teetering head where only a ﬂapping hinge is ﬁtted and
tilting in the other axis is accommodated by the feathering hinges. This type of head
can be seen on the Bell 206 JetRanger. It is not obvious how this arrangement can
act as a universal joint to allow the disc to tilt in any direction relative to the mast.
The answer is that the feathering bearings are used to provide the additional degree
of freedom. Figure 4.34(c) shows a helicopter with a teetering rotor hovering with an
offset CM. The control axis and the tip path axis are vertical, but the shaft axis is not.
As the rotor turns, the blades remain at a constant pitch relative to the tip path axis
and the control axis, but need to turn in the feathering bearings to do so. Thus in this
case it is the rotor head that is oscillating about the blade root and not vice versa.
The feathering bearings and the underslung teetering bearing act as a Hooke joint
to allow shaft axis to be different to the tip path axis. The Hooke joint is not ideal
because of the inclination of the feathering bearings at the coning angle, but for typical
shaft/tip path relationships the discrepancy is small. The Hooke joint is not a constant
velocity joint, and some torsional ﬂexibility will be required in the transmission.

158 The Art of the Helicopter
At (d) a variant of the teetering rotor is one in which the blades have individual
ﬂapping hinges so that no bending moments occur due to coning. This allows the blades
to be more lightly built than in a conventional teetering system, and also reduces 2P
hop. The effect of the offset between the ﬂapping hinges is eliminated by the action of
a third underslung bearing. This approach is known as a tri-hinge head and is used in
the Robinson R-22.
At (e) is the so-called door-hinge hub. This hub is relatively thin in section to reduce
drag. The thin section also introduces some ﬂexibility to reduce the effect of two-per
hop. This type of head was used on the Bell AH-1G.
At (f ) is the semi-teetering head of the Bell 222. This contains elastomeric feathering
bearings in compression, a thin ﬂexural section for accommodating 2P hop and a
centring spring on the teeter bearing to give stability in low-g manoeuvres.
Zero-offset heads are relatively intolerant of the CM location of the helicopter and
cause handling difﬁculties in low-g conditions. The teetering hinge also allows blade
sailing and starting the rotors may be impossible above a certain wind velocity because
of the danger of a boom strike. This was acceptable in early machines, and possibly
remains acceptable in today’s light machines, given the weight advantage due to the
elimination of dampers. However, it is not acceptable in helicopters intended for military or emergency service. Other types of head can overcome these difﬁculties.
Although most zero-offset heads have two blades, more blades can be ﬁtted.
Figure 4.10 showed the zero-offset head of the Sikorsky R-5 that has three blades. As
the ﬂapping hinge axes pass through the mast axis no ﬂapping moments can be communicated to the mast. However, the blades are individually hinged and no underslinging
is possible. This means that the CM of the coned rotor is above the ﬂapping bearings.
When the disc tilts relative to the mast this arrangement cannot allow the blades to conserve momentum and dragging hinges must be ﬁtted. This then requires drag dampers
and landing gear damping. Such a head is a poor combination because it needs the drag
hinge/damper complexity of the articulated head but does not offer the advantages.
In the classical articulated head the ﬂapping bearings are offset from the mast axis
so that a couple is exerted on the mast when the disc tilts, tending to make the hull
follow the disc attitude. This couple may also be used to allow a non-ideal hull CM
position. Any number of blades can be ﬁtted in this way, usually between three and nine.
When coned, the disc does not ﬂap about its CM and so dragging hinges are needed.
It was realized early that making the ﬂapping and dragging hinges intersect allowed a
conventional Hooke joint to act as ﬂapping and dragging hinge. The feathering bearing
was then placed outboard. This arrangement became relatively standard for a long
time and appeared on rotor heads from numerous manufacturers including Sikorsky,
Westland and Enstrom. The larger Mil machines place the dragging axis outboard of
the ﬂapping axis, probably to allow space for dragging dampers when a large number
of blades are required.
The ﬂapping blades need droop and sailing stops and sometimes these are centrifugally operated so that they only operate as the rotor slows down.
The articulated head results in a rotor that can start in higher winds than can a
teetering rotor, and which can retain some control at zero g. On the other hand the
articulated rotor is extremely complicated and needs a lot of maintenance. As materials have improved, it has become possible to build structures that will withstand
stress without excessive weight or that will ﬂex without fatigue. Thus instead of using
a mechanical hinge to relieve the stress, the designer has the choice of withstanding
the stress with a stiff structure or relieving it by ﬂexing. With modern materials such
as Kevlar and carbon ﬁbre it is possible to make a rotor in which ﬂexing is minimal.
However, this is not desirable as a great deal of vibration would be transmitted to the

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 158 — #42

Rotors in practice 159

hull and a very uncomfortable ride would result. Flapping blades act much like the
suspension of an automobile and decouple the effects of gusts and alternating components of lift in forward ﬂight. Another problem is that a perfectly rigid rotor would
respond extremely quickly to cyclic inputs, possibly too quickly for a human pilot.
As a result the extremely stiff rotor is little used. Instead the goal is to make hingeless
or bearingless rotors where vibration decoupling and stress relief are achieved not by
an identiﬁable hinge, but by a low maintenance structure which is designed to ﬂex.
The term virtual hinge will be met to describe the existence of an axis about which
ﬂexing effectively takes place. Virtual ﬂapping hinges decouple the non-constant lift
in forward ﬂight and virtual dragging hinges allow the blades to conserve momentum.
The presence of the ﬂexibility reduces bending stress in the blades and reduces the cyclic
response rate of the rotor. It is also possible to incorporate the feathering hinge into
the ﬂexible structure.
The designer can choose an appropriate degree of ﬂexibility depending on the role
of the machine. For some military purposes, such as nap-of-the-earth ﬂying, extreme
manoeuvrability is required along with the requirement to sustain zero or negative g
when cresting a hill at speed. This would suggest a rotor that is relatively stiff in ﬂapping,
which would also be able to start in almost any wind. Conversely a civil machine would
beneﬁt from a softer ﬂapping ﬂexure.
Dragging ﬂexures are also subject to variations. If the dragging virtual hinge is made
very stiff, the rotor can be made supercritical so that dragging dampers are not needed.
However, stiff-in-plane rotors tend to produce more lateral vibration because the blades
transmit the drag changes as they move between the advancing and retreating sides. As
an alternative, the soft-in-plane rotor reduces vibration by allowing the blades to drag,
but requiring drag damping to avoid ground resonance. The use of elastomeric damping
will still allow a low maintenance structure. Clearly the dragging and ﬂapping stiffness
can advantageously be different and some ingenuity is required to provide suitable
geometry.
Figure 4.35(a) shows the hingeless rotor head of the Bo-105. The only real bearings
are for blade feathering. Flapping and dragging movements are accommodated through
ﬂexing of the blade shank. The dragging stiffness is supercritical and no dampers are
needed. This is also a relatively stiff head in ﬂapping, and pendulum vibration dampers
are needed.
Figure 4.35(b) shows another stiff-in-plane head, that of the Lockheed AH-56
Cheyenne. This has door-hinge feathering bearings for low drag and a virtual ﬂapping hinge. The ﬂapping hinge is very stiff indeed and the following rate of the rotor
is very high, requiring full-time gyro stabilization. This will be considered in detail in
Chapter 7.
Figure 4.35(c) shows a soft-in-plane hingeless rotor from the Westland Lynx. Here
the ﬂapping ﬂexure is a massive piece of titanium that is only ﬂexible in the context of
the enormous forces set up in a rotor head. The ﬂexures are relatively stiff in ﬂapping.
Since the rotor can exert large moments on the hull, the Lynx does not need a tall mast;
in fact it was a design goal to keep the height down to allow the machine to ﬁt into
transport aircraft, and a special low proﬁle gearbox was designed to go with the rotor.
With such a low rotor, the Lynx needs the tail boom to be angled down to give blade
clearance before turning up to mount the tail rotor.
Figure 4.35(d) shows the head of the Bell 412. This has outboard dragging hinges
and the drag damping is obtained by an elastomeric block acting on a inward extension
of the blade grip which also mounts the pitch arms. The dragging hinges are mounted
on ﬂex beams that can twist to act as feathering bearings and bend to allow ﬂapping.
Two such ﬂex beams are stacked to make a four-blade rotor.

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 159 — #43

160 The Art of the Helicopter
Figure 4.35(e) shows a head developed by Aerospatiale. This uses a spherical laminated elastomeric bearing which takes the axial blade thrust whilst allowing feathering,
ﬂapping and dragging. Elastomeric blocks are ﬁtted inside the blade grip and these
couple with extension arms on the hub. The arms are stiff in the dragging plane, but
the elastomeric block is in shear for dragging movements, giving a soft-in-plane characteristic and providing the drag damping. In ﬂapping the blocks are in compression
where they are quite stiff. Flapping ﬂexibility is provided through a virtual hinge in the
arms. The head arms also twist to allow feathering.
Figure 4.35(f) shows the head of the Bell 680. Pairs of blades are joined by long
composite yokes that divide to pass clear of the mast. The yoke bends to allow ﬂapping
and dragging and twists to allow feathering. The yoke is long so that the strain due to
feathering is moderate. The blade is attached at the end of the yoke, at some considerable
radius from the mast. The blade is hollow at the root forming a cuff so that much of
the yoke is inside the cuff. The inboard end of the cuff carries the pitch arm connected

forwards. Thus the drag damper is placed between the inboard end of the cuff and an
arm attached to the mast. The hollow cuff approach gives a very clean head.
Figure 4.35(g) shows the rotor of the Brantly (now Hynes) helicopter. This has conventional offset ﬂapping hinges, but the dragging hinges are placed part way down the
blade. This large drag hinge offset makes the rotor supercritical and no dampers are
required.

4.21 Blade construction
The rotor blade has an arduous life being subject to considerable and time-variant
forces which in the early days made that life all too short. The construction of rotor
blades has been the subject of numerous advances directed towards increasing blade life.
Early blades were built up rather like the wings of aircraft. Blades must have a certain
weight both to store energy in the case of engine failure and to prevent an excessive
coning angle. High torsional stiffness is also required. These requirements were initially
met by building the blade around a steel tube. Collars were attached to the tube and
these supported wooden ribs. A wooden leading edge was attached to the ribs and this
would contain a metal insert to bring the mass centroid of the blade forward. The
leading edge of the blade as far back as the spar might be covered with thin plywood.
The whole was then covered with canvas and doped. Such construction lent itself readily
to the incorporation of blade taper and twist. Machines having such blades had to be
hangared because the blades were porous and moisture absorption could cause them
to go out of balance. Such blades were of no use in tropical countries where the glues
used could not withstand heat, humidity and bacterial/insect attack.
The solution was to make all-metal blades. Typically the leading third of the chord
was a heavy D-shaped extrusion with the remainder of the chord made up of thin
sheet metal, perhaps supported by aluminium honeycomb. Initially riveting was used;
later advances in adhesives allowed bonded structures. Metal structures are subject to
fatigue, particularly given the alternating loads experienced by the helicopter blade. In
some blades a warning of cracks was given by pressurization of the blade and ﬁtting
a pressure indicator. In other cases the blade or spar was evacuated and a vacuum
indicator was used instead. If the indicator reading was incorrect this might indicate an incipient crack or bonding failure. The use of extrusions made it difﬁcult to
incorporate blade taper.
As the military helicopter developed, consideration was given to resisting battle damage by designing redundant structures. In civilian applications a redundant structure
can have a longer service life because a failure is not catastrophic. Redundant structures work by providing parallel paths for forces. In a rotor blade the single spar can
be replaced by a series of smaller parallel box spars. The box sections may be of glass
ﬁbre which give support against buckling to steel spars between them. In some cases the
spars can be made entirely of glass ﬁbre, but it will usually be necessary to incorporate
a metal strip bonded into the leading edge to give the correct mass centroid.
The trailing edge of the blade is relatively lightly loaded and it is advantageous if it is
not too stiff in bending in comparison with the leading edge because this combination
results in the blade washing out as it bends up; a stable condition. Generally a thin
outer skin is used which is supported against buckling by a low density ﬁlling material
such as alloy or composite honeycomb, foam plastic or end grain balsawood. In some
machines the trailing edge skin is deliberately weakened by chord-wise slits that allow
the blade stiffness to be deﬁned by the spar. The trailing edge of the blade is a relatively
non-critical structure and many machines have returned safely following substantial
trailing edge damage.
As the conditions in which machines can operate are extended, it becomes necessary
to protect against lightning strikes. The result of a strike is massive energy dissipation
in any material presenting electrical resistance to the current path. The means of protection is to make the outside surface of the blades electrically conductive and to bond
the blades together electrically. In this way potential differences across the rotor are
minimized along with the damage.

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 162 — #46

Rotors in practice 163

Abrasion is also a fact of life for rotor blades. Hovering stirs up dust and grit and
this can impact the leading edge of the blade. Composite blades may incorporate a thin
metal anti-abrasion skin wrapped around the leading edge. In many cases a sacriﬁcial
coating made of self-adhesive tape is applied. This can be peeled off without damage
to the blade and replaced.

4.22 Blade tracking
Blade tracking is the process of adjustment that makes each blade ﬂy identically. In the
hover with the CM of the hull at the mast the blades should all have the same coning
angle and the tips should all be in a single plane. If this is not the case there will not be
a force balance at the hub and the result will be vibration. The tracking adjustment is
performed by change to the length of the pushrod going to each blade pitch arm. The
ball joints are attached to the pushrods with a screw thread to allow length adjustment.
It should be pointed out that a tracking adjustment can only succeed if the blades
concerned are correctly statically and dynamically balanced. There may also be vibration if a piece of blade abrasion tape has come off or if the tape application on the
blades is not identical.
The traditional way of measuring the tracking was to apply a different colour of chalk
or greasepaint to each blade tip. A sheet of stout cloth on a frame was then brought
carefully up to the edge of the spinning rotor so that coloured witness marks would be
left on the cloth. If one blade were out of track it would leave a witness mark above or
below the others. Clearly this method was not for the faint hearted and could only be
done on the ground with the helicopter supporting some of its weight with the rotor.
Subsequently a system was devised in which inward facing coloured reﬂectors were
temporarily ﬁxed to the blade tips. These were illuminated by a strobe light triggered
by a sensor on the mast so that as each blade passed the same azimuth angle the strobe
light would ﬂash. The machine could be ﬂown with the apparatus attached and if
the tracking was incorrect the reﬂectors would appear at different heights. Clearly the
machine would have to be shut down each time an adjustment was required. Some
helicopters have motorized adjustments that allow the pitch rod to change its length in
ﬂight. The optimum adjustment may be obtained by adjusting to minimize vibrations
at some speciﬁed operating condition.
In some machines trim tabs are ﬁtted to the trailing edge of the blades, which can be
used to compensate for the effect of slight differences between the blades in forward
ﬂight.

4.23 Blade folding
The blades of a helicopter may take up a great deal of room and in some applications, such as operation from ships, folding blades will be needed as a practical matter.
In a small machine this may be achieved entirely manually after ﬁrst removing the
locking pins. However, in large helicopters manual folding is not viable and a poweroperated system will be needed. Figure 4.36 shows the blade folding system of the
Sea King. In this ﬁve-bladed machine, one blade is positioned over the tail boom
and does not fold. Blade folding can only take place if the rotor head is turned to
exactly the correct angle. After the rotor has stopped, an hydraulic motor will turn
the rotor to the correct angle and the shaft will then be locked.

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 163 — #47

“helic - chap04” — 2003/11/22 — page 164 — #48
Fig. 4.36 Blade folding mechanism of the Sea King. See text.

Rotors in practice 165

There are some additional complexities involved in blade folding. First, folding the
blade will put the blade centre of mass a long way from the feathering axis and the
resulting couple could damage the swashplate and controls. This is prevented by a
mechanism that locks the feathering bearings. Second, motion of the lead-lag hinges
can interfere with the folding and it is necessary to position the lag hinges correctly.
The lag dampers are also hydraulic rams.
Hydraulic pressure is supplied to the rotor head through a rotating seal. Initially, the
lag hinges are positioned by applying pressure to the dampers. The dampers carry limit
valves to allow ﬂuid to ﬂow once they have reached the end of their travel. This ﬂuid
ﬂow operates the feathering bearing locks. The feathering bearing lock pins operate
further limit valves to allow ﬂuid to ﬂow to the folding mechanism proper.
Locking pins in the hinges will then be withdrawn by hydraulic power. The retraction
of the lock pins operates sequence valves which then apply ﬂuid pressure to the bladefolding rams inside the rotor head. These drive sector gears in order to turn the hinges
through the large angles needed. The hinge axes are not vertical, so that the blades fold
back and down alongside the hull.
As the folding mechanism is self-sequencing, unfolding the blades is achieved simply
by reversing the direction of hydraulic pressure on the rams. The folding rams retract
to swing the blades out, and limit valves then apply pressure to the lock pin rams,
which lock the folding hinges. Limit valves on the lock pins then allow pressure to the
feathering bearing locks in order to release the pins. When the feathering lock pins
retract, further limit valves allow ﬂow to reposition the lag dampers.
For obvious safety reasons, the hydraulic interlocks ensure that the sequence cannot
complete if any stage fails to operate. As a further precaution, the positions of the
major elements are monitored by switch to operate a cockpit warning if any part is out
of sequence.
Blade folding mechanisms are inevitably complex. In certain versions of the Osprey,
not only do the blades fold parallel to the wing, but the wing also rotates 90◦ to align
with the hull. Blade folding is expensive, adds weight and increases maintenance and
will only be used where it is absolutely essential.

The tail

5.1 Introduction
Helicopters with a single main rotor must have some means of balancing the torque
reaction due to driving the rotor. Whilst the anti-torque rotor could be mounted anywhere for hovering, in forward ﬂight the most stable location is aft, supported on some
kind of structure called a boom. In addition to the anti-torque function helicopters
need some means of yaw control and the tail rotor also serves that purpose. In order to
balance the weight of machinery at the tail, the helicopter cabin usually extends some
way forward of the mast. This large forward side area is unstable in yaw and generally
some ﬁn area is needed to give directional stability in forward ﬂight. A further consideration is that the main rotor on its own is unstable in pitch in forward ﬂight and a
tail plane is usually required.
As a result the tail of the conventional helicopter will be a structure supporting a
variable pitch tail rotor, its transmission and controls, some ﬁn area and a tail plane. In
reality tail booms are also encrusted with antennae, ﬂare launchers, navigation lights,
strobe beacons, static vents, registration letters and warning notices, not to mention
tail skids and occasionally part of the undercarriage.
In a helicopter with more than one rotor the torque may be cancelled in a different
way and a great variety of yaw control mechanisms will be found. These multi-rotor
yaw mechanisms are considered in Chapter 9. In this chapter the conventional type
of tail rotor will be considered, along with a number of alternatives having various
advantages and drawbacks. The conventional tail rotor is well understood and relatively
inexpensive owing to its wide use.
The far aft location of the tail rotor assembly means that it must be lightly built in
order to avoid the machine becoming tail heavy. The thrust needed from the tail rotor is
much smaller than that needed in the main rotor. These two features conspire to ensure
that the tail rotor is considerably more fragile than the main rotor. Unfortunately the
fragile tail rotor is in a more exposed location where the pilot cannot see it. During
certain manoeuvres, such as quick stops and rearward ﬂight it can get very close to
the ground, and it may come off worse in any encounter with vegetation the pilot has
not seen. Tail rotor blades are usually ﬁtted with soft aluminium ‘telltales’ at the tips
which will be distorted by any impact and indicate that a close inspection for damage
is required.
Generally the tail boom will be ﬁtted with some kind of skid intended to impact
the ground before the tail blades. In some cases this is a tubular structure partially
encircling the rotor and known as a D-ring. This gives better protection as well as

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 166 — #1

The tail 167

being more visible to ground personnel than the spinning rotor. The Enstrom F-28
series has a conspicuous D-ring.
The fast spinning tail rotor is actually very hard to see under many lighting conditions
and a signiﬁcant number of ground personnel have literally walked into one, often with
fatal results. The problem is that the human visual system cannot respond to light
changes above the critical ﬂicker frequency which is at about 50 Hz. Unfortunately
the blade-passing frequency of most tail rotors is beyond this. The result is that when
looking at a spinning tail rotor, there is literally nothing to focus on and the eye tends to
see only the background beyond the rotor, especially if this is more brightly illuminated
than the rotor. A further problem is that when a hovering helicopter yaws, the tail rotor
may move laterally at some speed, too fast for someone on the ground to move clear.
Unfortunately most helicopters don’t have rear view mirrors and the pilot may be
unable to see a person near the tail.
There have been too many tragedies due to these effects, and these can be avoided by
some simple rules. Ground personnel should never approach a hovering helicopter or
one on the ground with turning blades unless the captain has indicated that it is allowed.
If a conventional helicopter must be approached, it should only be from directly ahead,
in full view of the captain. Helicopter pilots should avoid initiating rapid yaws in a low
hover, as this gives an unnoticed person on the ground no chance of escape and increases
the risk of striking the tail rotor on obstacles. It is good practice to paint both dark
and bright patches on the tips of the tail rotor blades so that some contrast will be
available whatever the background. Painting the patches at a different radius on each
blade causes a spiralling or ﬂickering effect that is more noticeable. In the case of a
multi-bladed tail rotor, the ﬂicker frequency can be lowered into the visible range by
painting all of the blades a dark colour except for one which should be as brightly
painted as possible. Another useful safety feature is to have a tail plane-mounted light
to illuminate the tail rotor.
An increasingly relevant drawback of the conventional tail rotor is that it seems to
generate a lot of noise. Although the tip speed is typically about the same as that of the
main rotor, the tail rotor turns at higher RPM and so the blade-passing frequency is
higher. This in itself doesn’t make more noise, but human hearing is more sensitive to
the increased frequency and so it seems louder. Another problem is that the tail rotor
often works in the disturbed wake of the main rotor and impulse noise will be created
when a main rotor vortex passes through the tail because this causes rapid variations
in local angle of attack.
From some directions the tail rotor may be the noisiest part of the machine. Society is
quite reasonably becoming less tolerant of noise, and there is no reason for the aviation
community to expect special treatment. In military applications helicopter noise may
also be an issue. The helicopter excels at inserting and retrieving special forces, but
covert missions are likely to be compromised by excessive noise.
Helicopter designers have explored various ways of countering the main rotor torque
in a way that reduces or eliminates one or more of these problems. These techniques
give a noise reduction and a safety advantage, but currently at an increased cost. The
fenestron system uses a fan enclosed in a short duct in much the same location as a
conventional tail rotor. The NOTAR system (NO TAil Rotor) uses a combination of a
sideways-lifting tail boom and air jets at the end of the boom. There is a fan inside the
hull providing air for boundary layer control over the boom and for the tip jets. These
systems will be considered in later sections of this chapter.
The tail rotor needs power and control. The power is generally delivered from the
main gearbox by a light shaft supported by regularly spaced bearings to prevent
whirling. Flight loads can cause the tail boom to ﬂex and the drive shaft must be

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 167 — #2

168 The Art of the Helicopter
ﬁtted with couplings to accommodate small angular errors and plunging. This avoids
putting unnecessary stress on bearings and on the shaft itself. Often the shaft will be
run on the outside of the tail boom to allow easy inspection. The shaft may be exposed,
or covered by a D-shaped detachable cowling as in, for example, the Bell 206.
The tail rotor gearbox is relatively simple since it has only to turn the drive through
90◦ . The output shaft bearings will be designed to support the tail rotor and withstand
ﬂight loads. An oil level sight glass will be provided, and generally a chip detector. In
large machines an oil temperature gauge may be ﬁtted.
The tail rotor only requires collective pitch control and so it will have a swashplate
which moves along the shaft axis but without tilting. There are various ways of moving
the swashplate via the foot pedals. The pedals usually communicate with the tail using a
pair of stranded steel wires, since these are light in weight. Figure 5.1 shows that there is
some variety in the mechanisms used to convert the wire motion into movement of the
swashplate. Figure 5.1(a) shows an example where the swashplate runs on the gearbox
casing between the rotor and the gearbox. A simple bell crank and fork arrangement
will move the swashplate. Figure 5.1(b) shows a system in which a pitch control rod
runs through the hollow tail rotor shaft to a swashplate which is outboard of the rotor.
This may be operated by a bell crank as before. The pitch control rod may be terminated
in a coarse screw thread. The wires from the foot pedals are wound round a drum that

The tail 169

rotates the rod in the screw thread. Alternatively the drum may be replaced with a
sprocket engaging a length of roller chain inserted in the wire.
An elegant improvement is to couple the collective pitch setting into the tail rotor
pitch controls so that to some extent torque variations are automatically compensated.
The Westland Lynx has such a system.
In larger machines a power assistance system may be necessary and this will be
considered in Chapter 7.

5.2 Balancing the torque
The torque reaction of the main rotor is a pure couple, which is to say it has only a
turning effect, and no resultant force in any direction. The tail rotor is mounted pointing
sideways at the tail, and so the thrust it produces results in a moment about the centre
of gravity of the machine. Unfortunately a moment cannot cancel a couple. The thrust
of the tail rotor can be adjusted completely to cancel the rotation of the machine, but
if the main rotor thrust is vertical, the tail rotor thrust will cause the machine to move
sideways, a phenomenon called tail rotor drift. Tail rotor drift is prevented in the hover
by tilting the main rotor disc in the opposite direction. Figure 5.2(a) shows that the
main rotor thrust can be resolved into a vertical component opposing the weight of
the machine, and a horizontal component. When the latter is equal to the tail rotor
thrust, a perfect couple has been produced that opposes the main rotor torque reaction
completely. The pitch of the tail rotor blades is controlled using the foot pedals. By
disturbing the balance of the couples, yaw control is obtained.
A very slight increase in rotor thrust is necessary so that the vertical component still
balances the weight. The tilted attitude of the disc during hover can readily be seen.
The hull may or may not tilt due to the disc tilt, depending on the design of the rotor
head, the way the transmission is installed and the location of the tail rotor. If the
hull tilts, the CM of the helicopter, being some way below the rotor hub, will develop
a rolling couple that can only be zero when the CM is directly below the rotor head.
The ﬁnal attitude of the hull will be at whatever angle this restoring couple balances
the tilting couples from the rotor head and the tail rotor.
Figure 5.2(b) shows that if the tail rotor thrust is not in the plane of the main rotor,
there will be a couple about an axis through the rotor head running in a fore-and-aft
direction. The ﬁgure shows the situation viewed from the rear of a helicopter having
a clockwise-from-the-top rotor and the tail rotor below the plane of the disc. In this
case, the side force from the main rotor is above the side force from the tail rotor and
this causes a clockwise roll couple called tail rotor roll.
If the tail rotor is above the plane of the rotor (seldom seen in practice), the side force
results in an anticlockwise couple. Clearly it is only when the tail rotor shaft is in the
plane of the main rotor hub that this couple will be zero, and helicopters which mount
the tail rotor high on the top of the ﬁn can achieve this elegant result, although there
are more important reasons for such a location, which will be explored in section 5.5.
The reader is cautioned that some texts assert that the tail rotor must be mounted at
the same height as the centre of mass to eliminate tail rotor roll, but this is incorrect.
In fact if the tail rotor is mounted at the vertical centre of mass of the hull, the couple
due to the different heights of the main and tail rotor side thrusts makes the hull tilt
until it is balanced by the couple due to the laterally displaced CM. This is shown in
Figure 5.2(c). The result is that the shaft axis and the tip path axis align and so there
is no lateral ﬂapping and the type of rotor head is irrelevant because, with no ﬂapping,

170 The Art of the Helicopter

(a)

(b)

(c)

Fig. 5.2 (a) The force from the tail rotor cannot cancel a couple. In practice the main rotor is tilted so that a
horizontal component of the main rotor thrust exists. When this is exactly equal to the tail rotor thrust a pure
couple has been created. If this is equal to the torque reaction due to driving the main rotor the helicopter will
not yaw. (b) If the tail rotor is not at the same height as the rotor head there will be a rolling couple. (c) If
the tail rotor is aligned with the vertical location of the helicopter’s CM, the tail rotor roll couple is exactly
balanced by the horizontally offset CM so that the main rotor does not tilt with respect to the hull. With all other
conﬁgurations the hull and the main rotor will have different attitudes.

there can be no rolling couple from the head. In all other cases the shaft and tip path
axes are different and so the type of rotor head becomes signiﬁcant.
As was seen in Chapter 4, the zero-offset rotor head is effectively a universal joint
that allows the hull to hang straight down. Other rotor heads are stiffer and the hull
will hang at whatever angle causes all of the couples to cancel one another.
If the helicopter has a zero-offset rotor, and the tail rotor is in the plane of the rotor
hub, the fuselage will hang so that the CM is vertically below the rotor head. This will
result in a laterally level cabin, assuming there is no payload asymmetry.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 170 — #5

The tail 171

In the case of a rotor having offset hinges, a teetering spring or a hingeless head, the
rotor head can apply a couple to the fuselage trying to roll the shaft axis in line with the
tip path axis. The angle at which the fuselage settles in the hover will now be a function
of the rotor head ﬂapping stiffness, the vertical position of the hull CM and the tail
rotor roll.
Finally, the designer may mount the main transmission at a suitably slight angle so
that the hull stays more or less level with the disc and shaft tilted by the same amount.
This means there will be little or no ﬂapping in the hover. The Sikorsky Skycrane is an
example of this approach. In the Mi-24 Crocodile (NATO code name Hind), the hull
and transmission are tilted with respect to the undercarriage so that disc is tilted at
approximately the correct angle. To compensate, the hull is twisted ahead of the main
rotor so the cockpit remains level.
In forward ﬂight the hull is moving through the air and so can develop a side thrust
if it is set to a suitable angle of attack. If the machine is ﬂown with no sideslip, the
side thrust must come from the rotor tilt, whereas if the rotor disc is level, the side
thrust must come from side slipping the hull. Clearly the machine can be ﬂown with
any combination of these two effects.
The least drag will be suffered if the hull is aligned with the direction of travel, and
this may be signiﬁcant under marginal power conditions. Zero-slip trim has the further
advantage that the compass or direction indicator is actually displaying the helicopter’s
heading, making navigation easier. Flying at zero slip is aided by an airﬂow-sensing
device showing the direction from which the air is approaching the hull.
Unfortunately most helicopters are ﬁtted with an instrument inherited from ﬁxedwing aviation, where it is more useful. It is called a slip indicator because in ﬁxed-wing
aircraft that is what it does. It is not commonly appreciated that in helicopters the same
instrument does not indicate true slip. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter 7.

5.3 The conventional tail rotor
The conventional tail rotor is mechanically a small main rotor. The term small being
relative because, for example, the tail rotor of the Mi-26 is about the same size as the
main rotor of an MD-500 and produces a similar thrust. The tail rotor needs no cyclic
pitch control, only a collective mechanism actuated by the pedals. Aerodynamically
it is also a scaled down main rotor, having much the same physics in the hover, and
suffering the same indignity of being thrust through the air edge-on in translational
ﬂight.
As the tail rotor is expected to produce thrust in either direction, the blade section
will generally be symmetrical and blade twist is only occasionally used. Blade taper
can still be usefully employed to make the inﬂow more even, and this has been seen in
practice, although it is not common because constant chord blades are cheaper to make
from metal. When blades were made of wood, taper was relatively easy to adopt and as
the use of moulded composites grows there is a possibility that taper will make a return.
The teetering rotor has many advantages for use at the tail, and the disadvantages
it has as a main rotor are not relevant. As a teetering tail rotor is supercritical (see
section 4.15) it cannot suffer from ground or air resonance. The two-bladed teetering
tail rotor is simple and therefore light and has become extremely common. Teetering
can still be used with four-blade rotors. Two independently teetering rotors can be
ﬁtted to a common shaft with a small offset between the disc planes. It is not necessary
to mount the two rotors 90◦ apart; in fact it is advantageous not to do so. Mounting
the blades in an X or scissors conﬁguration produces less noise because there is no

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 171 — #6

172 The Art of the Helicopter
longer a dominant blade-passing frequency. Additionally with a carefully chosen skew
angle and spacing between the two rotors a small gain in aerodynamic efﬁciency can
be obtained because the axially spaced pairs of blades act to some extent like staggered
biplane wings.
As with the main rotor, airspeed alternately adds to and subtracts from the blade
speed due to rotation. The resulting roll couple is subject to precession and the result
will be ﬂapback and dragging. As the tail rotor tip path axis is tilted backwards due
to the ﬂapping, the thrust has a rearward component acting as a drag which the main
rotor has to overcome. However, the inﬂow has a small component along the tip path
axis in forward ﬂight reducing the angle of attack and the shaft power needed. The
power saved is then available to the main rotor and is precisely the correct amount the
main rotor needs to overcome the drag. As a result tail rotor ﬂapping is not detrimental
to efﬁciency but it could lead to stress and/or wear.
In very large helicopters the tail rotor will need both ﬂapping and dragging articulation to contain the stresses and the dragging axis will need damping. In smaller
machines it is enough to have ﬂapping hinges. The hinge will often incorporate some
delta-three effect (see section 4.7). The delta-three hinge has the effect that as the rotor
ﬂaps, some cyclic pitch change is applied. The rotor ﬁnds equilibrium with a smaller
amount of ﬂapping.
The tail rotor counters the torque of the main rotor in the hover, but it also aids
the directional stability of the machine in forward ﬂight by acting as a ﬁn. Figure 5.3
shows how this happens. If the tail swings to one side or the other, a component of
the airspeed will change the inﬂow and with it the angle of attack. The result will be
a change of thrust in such a sense as to return the tail to its original position. This
is a highly desirable characteristic, except in rearward ﬂight where the effect makes
the machine unstable in yaw. An attempt to ﬂy backwards at speed results in the tail
swinging round, a phenomenon known as weathercocking.

Fig. 5.3 The tail rotor acts like a ﬁn in forward ﬂight because if the machine yaws, the angle of attack of the
tail rotor blades will change in the sense that opposes the yaw.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 172 — #7

The tail 173

The tail rotor designer is faced with permanent compromise. Chapter 3 showed that
the least power is needed if a rotor has a large diameter and a low, uniform, induced
velocity. Proﬁle power is reduced if the tip speed is low. Unfortunately the solidity will
have to go up and the resulting tail rotor will be very heavy. To make matters worse,
the large tail rotor will have to be mounted further aft to maintain clearance with the
main rotor and this will require a longer and heavier tail boom. Ground clearance may
also be an issue. There are further problems with large, slow, tail rotors. With a very
low tip speed the translational speed will be limited by the growth of the reverse ﬂow
area. In the hover if the induced velocity is too low the tail rotor can enter a vortex ring
condition during a yaw.
In fact minimizing tail rotor power is not the goal. A more useful goal is to minimize
the ratio of the total power absorbed by both rotors to the overall machinery weight.
A highly efﬁcient but heavy tail rotor may need more total power as the main rotor
has to work harder to lift it. As a result the designer will settle for a tail rotor diameter
that contains the weight and clearance problems, and a tip speed similar to that of the
main rotor so that the same advance ratio is obtained. As a result the only room for
variation is in the solidity and taper. As a design evolves, the solidity can be adapted
by changing the number of blades. For example, the Super Puma has four tail blades,
whereas the original Puma had ﬁve. In some helicopters the high tip speed tail rotor
was replaced in a later model with a slower version to reduce noise. This may need
more blades to increase the solidity.

5.4 Tail rotor location
The tail rotor and the main rotor are both actuator discs and both produce thrust by
virtue of the induced velocity they impart to their respective inﬂows. The main and tail
rotors cannot be considered independently because of their proximity. They can and
do affect each other by interaction of inﬂow to a degree that varies considerably from
one regime of ﬂight to another.
In the hover a low mounted tail rotor will actually draw air in from the edge of the
main rotor. This will result in an increase in the induced velocity experienced by the
main rotor and it will need more power. This might amount to 10–20 kW in a mediumsized helicopter. If the tail rotor is mounted higher the effect is largely eliminated and
some power can be saved.
Figure 5.4(a) shows that the increased pressure below the main rotor disc and the
reduced pressure above causes air to ﬂow in a toroidal path around the edge of the disc.
This is the mechanism of tip loss. The tail rotor operates in this region and there is a
strong interaction. When the tail rotor turns in the same direction as the main rotor
vortices (b) the relative airspeed of the tail blades is reduced and the available thrust
is limited. When the tail rotor turns against the main rotor vortex (c) the performance
is considerably enhanced because of the square-law connection between thrust and
speed. There appears to be no detrimental aerodynamic effect of this direction, and so
it is now considered to be the only direction to employ.
This phenomenon was understood relatively late in the history of the helicopter with
the result that many machines were designed with the tail rotor going the ‘wrong’ way.
In many cases in later models the tail rotor direction was reversed to universal acclaim.
Oddly enough many model helicopters are still designed (if that is the word) with the
wrong tail rotor direction. The author has modiﬁed a number of models to have the
‘right’ rotation and can vouch for the improvement in these cases also.

Fig. 5.4 (a) In the hover there is a toroidal ﬂow around the edge of the main rotor in which the tail rotor
operates. (b) A wrong-way tail rotor has its effective speed of rotation reduced by the main rotor ﬂow. (c) A
right-way tail rotor has its effective speed of rotation increased by the main rotor ﬂow and will thus have greater
authority. (d) Owing to wake contraction, it is more efﬁcient to use a ‘blower’ tail rotor that takes in air over the
mounting structure. If the tail rotor is on the wrong side the structure blocks a larger proportion of the wake.

As was seen in Chapter 3, with axial ﬂow in the hover the wake of the tail rotor
contracts and speeds up just as it does in the main rotor. This means that there is
a right way and a wrong way to mount the tail rotor with respect to its supporting
structure, which inevitably causes some blockage. The supporting structure may be a
slim tube or a substantial tail ﬁn. Figure 5.4(d) shows that if the tail rotor slipstream
is directed away from the ﬁn, a so-called ‘blower’, the proportion of the inﬂow which
is blocked is reduced. The relative airspeed at the blockage is also lower. If instead
the thrust is directed away from the ﬁn, this blocks a larger proportion of the now

contracted slipstream which also has a higher relative airspeed. The thrust loss due to
blockage will be signiﬁcantly higher. There is thus a ‘right’ side and a ‘wrong’ side to
mount a tail rotor; the blower installation will always be more efﬁcient in the hover. In
an ab-initio design, the right side, right direction tail rotor is an automatic choice.
The existence of the right side was appreciated well before that of the right direction,
and many machines appeared with this conﬁguration as shown in Figure 5.5(a). When
it was realized that the tail rotor should be reversed, cost considerations often dictated
the simple expedient of turning the tail rotor gearbox through 180◦ about its input shaft.
This had the desired effect on the rotation, but then put the tail rotor on the ‘wrong’
side as shown in Figure 5.5(b). The improvement obtained by turning the right way
exceeds the loss experienced by the increased blockage. As a result there are quite a few
right-direction wrong-side machines. The Westland Lynx and the Mil Mi-24 are both in
this category. In the Enstrom F-28A, the tail rotor originally went the ‘wrong’ way, but
by turning over the gearbox as described the blockage increase was negligible because
the tail rotor is mounted on a slim tube. The result was a signiﬁcant improvement in
tail rotor authority.
Figure 3.24(b) showed that in forward ﬂight the main rotor produces a trailing vortex
structure not unlike that of a wing. The streamlines converge above the plane of the
rotor and diverge below it. The tail rotor operates in this airﬂow and the yaw-stabilizing
action is affected by it. When the tail is mounted high, as in Figure 5.6(a) the amount
of inﬂow change for a given yaw is increased by the converging ﬂow, increasing the
yaw-stabilizing action. However, a low mounted tail rotor may be operating in the
diverging ﬂow (b) where the yaw-stabilizing action is actually reduced.
There are thus many good reasons to mount the tail rotor high on a cranked boom.
In addition to power saving in the hover, a high tail rotor is less likely to strike the
ground in a low level quick stop, and it enables a safe landing to be made in scrub. The
blades are less likely to suffer leading edge erosion from grit blown up by the downwash
during hovering. In forward ﬂight a raised tail rotor will produce greater directional
stability, and encounters a cleaner airﬂow. The elimination of tail rotor roll as shown
in section 5.2 is an elegant but not an essential bonus.
Unfortunately to site the tail rotor on a cranked tail boom requires an extra gearbox
in the tail rotor shaft, and a stiffer tail boom. This adds expense that is unwelcome in
smaller machines. In this case the requirement for a little extra power is not a problem
because the turbine engine is usually heavily derated. In larger machines, the power
loss becomes signiﬁcant and in very large machines a correspondingly large tail rotor
will be required and the issue of ground clearance also arises. Thus a cranked boom is

Fig. 5.6 The pressure drop across a main rotor in forward ﬂight causes a vortex system as shown. A high
mounted tail rotor (a) operates in the converging area of the vortex system and will have good weather-cocking
properties. A low-mounted tail rotor (b) may operate in a diverging area of the vortex system and be less
effective.

a better option on a large machine, good examples being the Mi-26 and the Sikorsky
CH-54 Skycrane.
In some helicopters the tail rotor is mounted in an unusual way. The Sikorsky series
S-65/Sea Stallion/Sea Dragon is one example. This is a very powerful machine having
a high disc loading, three engines and a seven-bladed main rotor needing an equally
powerful tail rotor on a cranked boom. Figure 5.7(a) shows that in a conventional
installation the side thrust from the high mounted tail rotor puts the tail boom under
torsional loading. By tilting over the ﬁn and tail rotor as in (b), the weight of the
tail rotor assembly applies a torsional load in the opposite direction and the vertical
component of the tail rotor thrust helps to carry the weight of the tail so that stress
in the tail boom is reduced. The extra power consumed by the tail rotor is offset by a
slight reduction in main rotor power as the latter is no longer carrying the whole weight
of the machine.
The Sikorsky Blackhawk also has a canted tail rotor, but for a different reason. In
solving various contradictory requirements, this machine turned out with a rearward

The tail 177

centre of mass. The solution was to cant the tail rotor so that it produces some lift
as well as side thrust. Canted tail rotors solve some problems but they do introduce
interaction between controls. For example, pedal inputs will also cause some pitching.
This is usually cancelled out to some extent by interconnections in the control system.

5.5 Tail rotor performance
In a still air hover, the slightest imbalance in the two couples will allow a slow yaw. If
the pilot applies pedal input, the helicopter will accelerate about the yaw axis, but as
it does so the tail rotor will then move through the air at a velocity determined by the
yaw rate and the boom length. This velocity will change the inﬂow conditions and alter
the RAF seen by the blades.
Figure 5.8 shows that the hardest yaw direction is against main rotor torque. The tail
rotor has to produce a higher than normal side thrust and the pitch of the blades will
increase to provide it. However, as the yaw proceeds, the tail rotor accelerates towards
the inﬂow, so that the inﬂow velocity increases. This has the effect of reducing the angle
of attack of the tail blades. This result is not surprising because in section 4.2 it was seen
that the collective control determines the vertical velocity in the main rotor because of
the same inﬂow effect. The yaw rate will come to equilibrium when the change in RAF
reduces the angle of attack to the point where the tail rotor thrust imbalance is equal
to the drag of the yawing tail boom.
If the yaw is required to be with the main rotor torque, the tail rotor needs to produce
less thrust and the blades will be set to a reduced pitch. As the tail accelerates, the inﬂow
velocity falls and this has the effect of increasing the angle of attack, again bringing
the yaw rate to a constant value. If a greater yaw rate is required, the blades will
need to be set to a negative pitch. This will also be a requirement of yaw control in
autorotation where the main rotor torque reaction becomes very much smaller and
changes direction.
When in a fast power-on yaw with the direction of main rotor torque, the tail
rotor may be in negative pitch and the inﬂow may reverse. The tail rotor can enter
a windmilling state where it is actually being driven by the airﬂow. At a critical yaw
rate the inﬂow becomes zero. As was seen in section 3.16, zero inﬂow is an undesirable
condition because it causes the rotor to enter a vortex ring or recirculation condition.

Fig. 5.8 When yawing against main rotor torque the tail rotor needs a large pitch angle in order to maintain
the angle of attack with the increased inﬂow velocity.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 177 — #12

178 The Art of the Helicopter
This represents a worst case in tail rotor performance. The result of a fast with-torque
yaw may be that when the pilot attempts to arrest it there is little response and the
required heading may be seriously overshot. This goes down badly in the military as it
spoils the weapon aiming.
It should be clear from Figure 5.8 that the tail rotor must have a wide pitch range
to allow rapid yaws in either direction and then even more to maintain that degree of
control in autorotation. A large positive pitch value is essential to permit a positive
angle of attack to be reached despite the high inﬂow of an against-torque yaw. This
means that when the with-torque yaw rate is high the rapid application of full opposite
pedal can result in an enormous angle of attack that may be enough to stall the blades.
This is doubly bad, ﬁrst because the yaw obtained will be in the opposite direction
to that intended and second because a stalled tail rotor puts the tail transmission
under an enormous torque loading. Everything at the tail of a helicopter is designed
to be light in weight and this includes the transmission. Stalling the tail rotor may do
damage. Consequently it is considered bad practice to stamp on the tail control pedals.
A better result will be obtained if the pedals are operated gradually. In some helicopters
tail drives actually did suffer damage and the designers responded by putting viscous
dampers on the pedals.
In addition to the yaw function, effective tail power is also needed for sideways
ﬂight. It is not obvious why anyone would want to ﬂy sideways, but there are plenty
of examples. Large ﬁlm cameras are often mounted in the main cabin and only have a
clear view to the side. Flying the machine sideways allows the camera to shoot forwards.
Flying sideways allows the pilot of an attack helicopter to dodge ﬁre whilst keeping
his rockets aimed at the target. Pilots who wouldn’t dream of doing the above also ﬂy
sideways as a matter of course, because this is exactly what happens when hovering
in a side wind. The helicopter only appears to be hovering; it’s actually ﬂying along
sideways at the same speed as the wind but in the opposite direction.
In the case of a clockwise-from-the-top helicopter, the wind coming from the
starboard side is undesirable as it increases the tail rotor inﬂow and so requires more
power. The worst case will then be where the pilot wishes to make a maximum speed
yaw to port in a strong wind from the starboard side. The tail rotor now has to overcome main rotor torque, boom drag due to the side wind and the yaw under conditions
of greatest inﬂow where its angle of attack is reduced. Needless to say this is how the
military test tail rotor performance.
Again assuming a clockwise-from-the-top helicopter, there will be a critical airspeed
in sideways ﬂight to starboard where the tail rotor is moving at the same speed as its
induced velocity and a vortex ring is again a possibility when the pilot tries to arrest
the manoeuvre.
Sufﬁcient shaft power is not generally a problem in a turbine helicopter as the main
rotor will be in translational lift in a side wind hover and there will be plenty of power
available for the tail rotor. The problem is whether the tail rotor can use the power
available. The blade pitch cannot be increased indeﬁnitely or the tail rotor may stall.
The RPM cannot be increased because of compressibility in forward ﬂight and the
diameter can’t be increased because this will need the boom to be lengthened and will
reduce ground clearance. One option is to increase the solidity of the tail rotor, typically
by adding blades. This is less efﬁcient, but it does at least solve the tail power problem.
Other options may include an assessment of the degree of blockage and/or the amount
of rear side area.
In a piston engine helicopter the tail rotor may not be powerful enough to allow
a crosswind hover above a certain windspeed. In some light helicopters this is not a
problem because that windspeed may also exceed the maximum speed at which it is

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 178 — #13

The tail 179

safe to start the rotors. However, some piston engine helicopters, such as the Enstrom,
can safely start the rotors in a gale and on moving to the hover it will be found that
the machine simply weathercocks into wind with the pedals only allowing a certain
yaw angle either way. The tail rotor is defeated by inﬂow and cannot obtain an angle
of attack.
In any tail rotor operation that increases the inﬂow, the blade reaction will tilt back
and the tail rotor will require more torque to drive it. This torque is provided by the
engine, and delivered by the long tail drive shaft. If the tail rotor absorbs more power
and nothing else happens, there will be less power for the main rotor. In a simple piston
engine machine, where there is seldom any sophisticated engine governing, yawing in
the same direction as the rotor turns will result in the machine also tending to descend.
The pilot has to compensate by raising the collective lever slightly, which will then
require more engine power. The tail rotor takes roughly 15% of the total power in
the still hover and more in the circumstances described above. Many piston-engine
helicopters don’t have a lot of surplus power and the pilot soon learns that large pedal
inputs in the hover in one direction are to be avoided. Given a choice, the pilot will
always prefer to yaw in the direction requiring the least tail power, using smooth and
gradual pedal applications. With limited power, yawing must be done slowly as there
is no point initiating a yaw in the ‘easy’ direction if it cannot be stopped.
In a turbine-powered helicopter the RRPM is accurately governed and so if a yaw in
the direction of main rotor rotation is initiated, the extra torque needed by the tail rotor
is automatically provided by action of the governor. As a result the RRPM relative to
the helicopter does not change. However, the whole helicopter is now turning with the
yaw and so the RRPM relative to the air has slightly increased. One might not expect
this to have much effect, but the yaw RPM can raise the effective RRPM by a few
percent and as lift is proportional to the square of the RRPM, a signiﬁcant increase in
lift can occur. Thus the turbine helicopter will climb under the same conditions that
caused the piston engine helicopter to descend.

5.6 The tail plane
The tail plane is a necessity in forward ﬂight for two reasons. First, because the main
rotor alone doesn’t have stability in pitch; and second, because the drag of the hull acts
some way below the rotor head, a moment results which tends to pitch the hull down.
The nose-down attitude of the hull will result in higher drag than if it is aligned with
the RAF. Figure 4.12 showed that an aft-mounted tail plane developing a down force
produces a moment in the opposite direction to the hull drag moment.
In a machine with a teetering or zero-offset head there can be no moments from the
rotor and so this mechanism determines the hull attitude. The hull will adopt a pitch
angle where the drag moment, the tail plane moment and any moment due to an offset
CM all sum to zero. The system is stable because if the hull pitches down the (negative)
angle of attack increases and produces a restoring moment.
In Figure 5.9 the machine has rotor head offset and the hull drag moment can be
balanced by any combination of the tail plane moment and a couple from the main
rotor due to the tip path axis being tilted with respect to the shaft axis. In practice a
couple from the main rotor will be obtained with the penalty of increased mast stress
and some vibration and so it is beneﬁcial to trim the hull attitude in cruise with the tail
plane so that a minimal rotor couple exists.
In the hover the tail plane is an unnecessary weight to be lifted and may actually
produce signiﬁcantly more down force than its weight if it is in the rotor downwash.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 179 — #14

180 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 5.9 In rotor heads having ﬂapping stiffness, a couple can come from the main rotor to help balance the
hull drag.

This is another example of requirements in hover and translation being at odds. In
practice it is not the hover download on the tail plane that is the major problem. Of
more concern is the serious fore-and-aft trim change that results should the downwash
move clear of or back onto the tail plane. In a teetering or zero-offset machine with
limited cyclic power this could cause control problems. In machines having higher
cyclic authority, a greater tail plane load in climb and autorotation can be handled. In
this case the trim shifts can be handled, but may present an excessive pilot workload,
especially if instrument ﬂight is contemplated.
There are three possible solutions to avoiding trim shifts of this kind. One is to
ensure that the tail plane is always in the downwash, another to ensure it is never in the
downwash and a third is to use a variable incidence tail plane or stabilator. Stabilators
are considered in the next section.
Helicopters often go through a surprising number of tail plane modiﬁcations and
locations as development proceeds and designers try to ﬁnd the right combination of
characteristics. Figure 5.10 shows some possible locations for the tail plane. At (a) the
tail plane is mounted well forward so that it is in the downwash at all but the highest
forward speeds. This is the approach used on, for example, the Bell 206 (JetRanger)
which has a teetering head. At (b) the tail plane is mounted high on the ﬁn so that it is
never in the downwash. This gives the least down force in the hover and a long moment
arm for stability at speed, but it does require a stiff and strong ﬁn and tail boom. The
MD-500 has a tail plane of this type with the tail rotor below and mounted in-line with
the tail boom to simplify the transmission.
Where the tail rotor shaft is mounted in the plane of the main rotor, an out-ofdownwash location can be obtained with an asymmetrical tail plane ﬁtted on the
opposite side of the ﬁn to the tail rotor. Many Sikorsky machines use this approach,
the S-65 being a good example, shown in Figure 5.10(c).
The tail plane can also be put below the tail rotor as in (d). This is almost out
of downwash in the hover, but as the machine moves forward from the hover the
downwash impinges on the tail plane from above causing a strong trim shift. In this
location, however, the tail plane does at least prevent ground personnel approaching
the tail rotor.
The section used on the tail plane is subject to some variation. In machines with
zero-offset heads, there is no couple from the rotor to prevent hull blowback in forward
ﬂight and this must all be balanced by tail plane downthrust. Such machines have
limited cyclic control authority and in autorotation the tail plane would produce an
undesirable upthrust. One solution is to use an upside-down cambered section that

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 180 — #15

The tail 181

Fig. 5.10 Tail plane locations: (a) forward location almost always in downwash. (b) ﬁn-top location is never in
the downwash. (c) Asymmetrical tail plane opposite the tail rotor. (d) Low aft-mounted tail plane causes strong
trim shifts but protects tail rotor.

efﬁciently produces downthrust in forward ﬂight but which stalls in autorotation. The
Bell 206 JetRanger uses this approach.
Another concern is avoiding tail plane stall in the climb where the (negative) angle of
attack becomes large. Sometimes leading edge slats will be used. Another solution is
to use a device called a Gurney ﬂap. This non-intuitive device consists of a thin tab set
across the trailing edge mounted at 90◦ to the chord line. The effect is to delay stalling
up to extremely large positive and negative angles of attack, with a small amount of
increased drag at low angles of attack. The Sikorsky S-76B uses such a device.

5.7 The stabilator
The stabilator is basically a variable-incidence tail plane that is moved to different
angles, generally automatically, according to the ﬂight regime. The stabilator and its
actuator will be more costly than a ﬁxed tail plane, so there must be a good reason to
employ it. The advantage of the stabilator is that it can be aligned with the downwash
so that it can give the stabilizing effect of a tail plane without the unwanted down- or
uploads in climb or autorotation. A beneﬁcial reduction in pilot workload will result,
along with improved hover performance.
Figure 5.11(a) shows that in forward translational ﬂight the stabilator may assume
a slightly negative angle of attack to counter the hull drag moment. In the hover and
in slow forward ﬂight the stabilator will move to a large positive angle (b) in order to
minimize the download. In a steep climb, the stabilator may also adopt a small positive
angle (c). This not only reduces download and aids the climb, but it also levels the
hull. In a tandem seat attack helicopter this may give the pilot in the rear seat a better
view forward in a climb. Figure 5.11(d) shows that in autorotation the stabilator should
move to a negative pitch to avoid an upload which would pitch the machine nose down.
In addition to these deterministic movements, the stabilator may also be linked to an
artiﬁcial stability system based on gyroscopic pitch sensors in the hull.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 181 — #16

182 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 5.11 The stabilator is a variable incidence tail plane that aligns itself with the direction of airﬂow in
different ﬂight regimes to improve performance. In forward ﬂight, (a) a slight negative angle of incidence
produces a downthrust to counter hull drag which acts below the rotor head. At (b) in the hover the stabilator
adopts a large positive angle of incidence to prevent the creation of a download. At (c) in the climb a smaller
positive angle of attack is beneﬁcial. In autorotation (d) a negative angle of incidence prevents an unwanted
upthrust.

Although stabilators are generally considered a good thing, some thought has to be
given during the design process to the results of an actuator or control system failure
leaving the stabilator in an inappropriate attitude. In a machine with a zero-offset
head this would probably not be acceptable. In a machine with higher control power
the incorrect tail loads following an actuator failure could be overcome by the cyclic
control at least at low airspeed.
In light helicopters the actuator could be a pneumatic device driven by a combination
of dynamic pressure from a pitot so that it responds to airspeed and manifold pressure
so it responds to power level. It may be advantageous to mount the tail plane on a
viscous damper with a suitable time constant that would stabilize brief perturbations
whilst aligning to long-term trends.

5.8 Fins
Fins may be applied to helicopters for the same reason as on ﬁxed-wing aircraft: to
enhance yaw stability in forward ﬂight. Secondary purposes of ﬁns may be to allow the
machine to ﬂy on following a tail rotor failure or to enhance control in autorotation,
especially in helicopters not having a tail rotor.
Fins are seen in a variety of locations as designers seek various compromises. In
the case of the high-mounted tail rotor, the tail rotor pylon is naturally extended and
streamlined to form the ﬁn. Low-mounted tail rotors with a single ﬁn tend to suffer
blockage as the tail rotor and the ﬁn have to be in the same place to clear the main
rotor. Blockage can be avoided by using end plates on the tail plane as ﬁns. These also
make the tail plane more efﬁcient as tip loss is reduced.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 182 — #17

The tail 183

Fig. 5.12 (a) A top-mounted ﬁn is efﬁcient in climb, especially if it has some sweepback. A ﬁn under the tail
boom is in turbulent air in the climb. (b) In autorotation the ﬁn under the boom becomes more efﬁcient.

A centrally mounted ﬁn is not in an ideal location as it will be in the turbulent
wake of the rotor head and mast. The result may be tail shake as vortices pass the ﬁn.
Mounting the ﬁn area at the ends of the tail plane will beneﬁcially move the ﬁns into
cleaner airﬂow.
The helicopter differs from ﬁxed-wing aircraft in that it doesn’t have to move the
way it is pointing. A helicopter with a near-level hull may be ﬂying level, climbing or
autorotating. Figure 5.12 shows that the relative airﬂow can approach the ﬁn from
a wide range of directions. At (a) in a climb, the RAF is angled downwards, and a
top-mounted swept-back ﬁn will present a high aspect ratio and be efﬁcient whereas a
bottom-mounted ﬁn is at a disadvantage and may also induce tail shake or ‘squirreling’
because of turbulence around the tail boom.
Figure 5.12(b) shows that in autorotation the position is reversed. The swept topmounted ﬁn now has a low aspect ratio and will be inefﬁcient. Thus in practice ﬁns are
frequently found with upper and lower sections both having sweepback as shown so
that good performance can be obtained both in climb and autorotation. The ﬁn of the
Bell 206 JetRanger is a good example. The same sweep conﬁguration may be found on
end-plate ﬁns such as the BK-117.
A large ﬁn area is beneﬁcial in forward ﬂight and if the tail rotor fails, but it will be a
drawback when hovering crosswind as it will create a large source of drag which must
be overcome by the tail rotor. As a result ﬁn area must be a compromise. In civilian
machines larger ﬁns may be found than those used in military machines because the
crosswind hovering requirement is not so important.
Fins are generally, but not always, ﬁxed. In some cases the ﬁn may be cambered
and/or ﬁtted at a small angle of attack to ofﬂoad the tail rotor in cruise. Sometimes
the ﬁn may be ﬁtted with a rudder or tab connected either to the pedals or to a yawstabilizing system. Pedal operated rudders are more common on coaxial helicopters
and synchropters.
Unlike the ﬁns of ﬁxed-wing aircraft, the helicopter ﬁn has to behave predictably
over a wide range of possible horizontal RAF directions because of the crosswind
hover requirement. One possibility is the adoption of the blunt trailing edge, as if
the rear of a conventional airfoil had simply been cut off. This technique allows the
ﬁn to operate up to a larger angle of attack without stalling. The penalty in forward
ﬂight is remarkably small because the increase in turbulence is balanced by a reduction
in wetted area. Blunt trailing edges were adopted on all Chinooks after the CH-47A,
and can also be used as a neat way of ﬁnishing off the rather fat ﬁn needed to contain
a fenestron.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 183 — #18

184 The Art of the Helicopter

5.9 The tail boom
The tail boom must provide structural support for the tail rotor, the ﬁn and the tail
plane, as well as having some aerodynamic characteristics. Figure 5.13(a) shows that a
tail boom which is a smooth continuation of the hull will have lower drag in forward
ﬂight than the ‘pod and boom’ construction shown at (b). However, a wide tail boom
will suffer a greater download in the hover. Figure 5.13(c) shows that the tail boom often
has a rounded rectangular shape to allow reasonable depth without excessive hover
download.
A streamlined tail boom may be practical on an executive transport, but for other
purposes rear loading ramps or clamshell doors may be needed and these always result
in a hull having higher drag. The boom has to be high set and slim to give clearance
for rear loading.
The tail boom effectively couples two masses together; the main rotor and the tail
rotor. These will each experience different forces, some static and some alternating. The
main rotor will apply vibrations to the hull, but the tail rotor will tend to lag behind
because of its mass and the result will be stress on the tail boom. Figure 5.14(a) shows
that when starting, whirling forces from the main rotor will rock the hull from side
to side. A tail rotor mounted atop the tail ﬁn will resist the rocking and place the tail
boom in torsion. The mass of the tail and the torsional stiffness of the boom will create
a resonant system and if the resonant frequency coincides with an exciting frequency
the tail assembly will oscillate in torsion.
If torsional oscillation results from a ﬂight frequency, the resonant frequency will
have to be changed. Intuitively, stiffening the tail boom would do this, but weakening
it would also change the resonant frequency to a lower value. A lengthwise slot in the

Fig. 5.13 (a) A hull in which the tail boom is smoothly faired into the cabin will cause less drag in forward
ﬂight. (b) A pod-and-boom structure suffers from turbulence at the rear of the pod. (c) Tail boom cross-section
which is deep but narrow gives strength without excessive download in the hover.

The tail 185

Fig. 5.14 (a) Main rotor lateral rocking during start-up places the tail boom under a torsional load. The inertia

Fore-and-aft rocking causes bending loads in the tail boom with a potential for resonance.

skin of a tail boom will reduce the torsional oscillation frequency without materially
altering the bending stiffness. Damping material may be placed across the slot where
it will be highly effective. Figure 5.14(b) shows that main rotor whirling in the foreand-aft direction subjects the tail boom to bending loads as does tail rotor imbalance.
Again a resonance may be present. The Robinson R-22 passes through some quite
noticeable tail boom bending resonances during rotor starting and the rotors must not
be run continuously at the RPM that excites them.
As the tail boom is in the downwash of the main rotor, it will create aerodynamic
forces. Figure 5.15(a) shows that in still air the force will be primarily downwards,
possibly with a slight, and beneﬁcial, sidethrust due to swirl. However, if there is a
crosswind, the resultant of the crosswind and the downwash will be a non-vertical
RAF seen by the boom. This may result in a signiﬁcant amount of boom lift, shown at
(b) which is not necessarily in a useful direction. If the boom lift opposes the tail rotor
thrust, this may restrict the crosswind hovering performance. A possible solution is the
addition of a boom strake mounted high on the boom. This has the effect of causing
early separation and a reduction in the amount of lift developed.
A cylindrical shape may be great for the pressurized hull of an airliner that goes
the way it is pointing, but it is generally less than ideal for transverse ﬂow. This is
because transverse airﬂow across a cylindrical shape is unstable. Separation takes place
from alternate sides causing lift in alternate directions. Those spiral strakes ﬁtted to
factory chimneys are designed to cause ﬂow separation at deﬁned points in order to
prevent shaking in a wind. A rounded helicopter hull or boom will also suffer from an
indeterminate separation point and this may result in chaotic shaking in the hover. In
this case a strake ﬁtted low on the boom will produce a deﬁned separation point and
reduce the shaking. Boom strakes generally align reasonably well with airﬂow in cruise
and so have little detrimental effect.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 185 — #20

186 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 5.15 (a) In still air hover, downwash on the tail boom is vertical except for a swirl component. (b) In
crosswind hover, the resultant airﬂow direction due to downwash and wind may cause signiﬁcant boom lift.
If this opposes the tail rotor thrust the crosswind hover performance may be impaired. A high-mounted boom
strake may be used to suppress boom lift in crosswinds, whereas a low-mounted boom strake may be used to
deﬁne a separation point for downwash in the hover and thereby reduce shaking.

Fig. 5.16 The fenestron is more than a ducted fan because some of the thrust is produced by the low pressure
on the intake side acting on the side of the ﬁn.

5.10 The fenestron
The fenestron is basically a ducted fan built into an opening in the tail ﬁn and was
developed by Aerospatiale. The name comes from the French fenêtre meaning a window. It is commonly thought that the fenestron works like a small tail rotor, but this
is not quite the case. In fact the ﬁn structure is responsible for a signiﬁcant amount
of the system thrust. Figure 5.16 shows that the fan in the fenestron is a multi-bladed
variable pitch device of high solidity. However, the fan is set in a duct that is relatively

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 186 — #21

The tail 187

long. The cross-section of the duct matches the stream tube contraction as the fan is
approached and so the reduced pressure caused by the fan is applied to the duct. As a
result the effective area of the fenestron is the area of the duct mouth. The close ﬁtting
duct effectively prevents blade tip loss. The direction of rotation of the fenestron should
be chosen on the same basis as that of a conventional tail rotor, namely the bottom
blade going towards the nose.
An advantage of the fenestron is that as it is set in the ﬁn, there can be no ﬁn blockage
as happens with a conventional tail rotor. In fact the ﬁn is augmenting the effect of
the fan. The fenestron presents a much reduced hazard to ground personnel and is
quieter. However, as the fenestron is inseparable from its duct assembly, a powerful
fenestron can become quite large and ground clearance may be an issue. Some machines
equipped with fenestrons have a sacriﬁcial collapsing bumper intended to absorb the
energy of an unintended ground contact after which it must be replaced.

5.11 NOTAR
A helicopter without a tail rotor has a number of advantages. It can land in scrub
without damage, ground personnel are less likely to be injured and there may be a
reduction in noise. The ﬁrst attempt at a tail rotorless machine was the experimental
Weir W-9, shown in Figure 5.17, that ﬂew in the UK in 1944. This machine had a piston
engine that, in addition to driving the main rotor, drove a variable pitch fan to blow air

Fig. 5.17 The Weir W-9 had no tail rotor but instead ducted cooling air and exhaust gases down the tail boom
to provide an anti-torque jet reaction. Twenty-ﬁve per cent of engine power was lost in the anti-torque system,
which was not pursued.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 187 — #22

188 The Art of the Helicopter
down the tail boom, cooling the engine in the process. The exhaust gases were mixed in
to provide further energy. At the rear of the hollow boom the gases were ejected from
a sideways-facing nozzle at about 150 feet/sec (45 m/sec). The Weir was also unusual in
having a constant velocity joint in its zero-offset rotor head. The Weir proved that the
tail rotor could be eliminated, but it also proved that a simple fan/nozzle arrangement
is very inefﬁcient: around 25% of the engine power was consumed in the anti-torque
system.
Stanley Hiller built a similar machine that ﬂew in 1946. At around the same time
Antoine Gazda built the Helicospeeder. These had piston engines. In France in 1954,
Nord ﬂew a machine called the Norelfe that used the exhaust from its turbine engine
to oppose torque. All were abandoned. Today it is clear that these results follow from
momentum theory. It is less efﬁcient to derive thrust by ejecting a small cross-section
of air at high speed than it is to eject a large cross-section slowly.
These experiments were enough to convince the industry that the tail rotor would not
quickly be replaced; not in fact for about 30 years. In the 1980s, McDonnell Douglas
developed a viable system which they called NOTAR and which does not require any
more power than the conventional tail rotor. The NOTAR system has two components,
a unidirectional system that provides about 60% of the anti-torque requirement, and
a bi-directional system that provides the remainder of the thrust as well as providing
yaw control.
The unidirectional system uses the tail boom as a wing operating in the rotor
downwash. The tail boom is cylindrical and boundary layer control is used. Figure 5.18
shows that on one side of the boom are two downward facing slots fed with air from the
interior and pressurized to about 1 psi by a fan. The air emerging from the slots energizes the boundary layer and delays separation signiﬁcantly so that the downwash ﬂows
around the boom and exits with a sideways component. Effectively the downwash has
been accelerated to the side and the reaction to this is a thrust on the boom. The thrust
has a lateral component and a downward component corresponding to the induced

Fig. 5.18 In the NOTAR system, the boom is pressurized by fan and ﬁtted with boundary layer control slots
that energize the ﬂow of the downwash to turn the tail boom into an airfoil.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 188 — #23

The tail 189

drag. However, the slots are emitting downward jets and this causes some upthrust that
nearly cancels the induced drag leaving a side thrust to counteract the torque.
About 60% of the anti-torque thrust comes from the boom. The remainder comes
from a nozzle at the extreme end of the boom. This has a stationary inner part and an
outer rotating sleeve. The inner part has a port on both sides, whereas the outer part
has a single port. The pilot’s foot pedals rotate the sleeve so that it will uncover one or
other port to allow yaw control. The degree to which the sleeve turns determines the
amount of port opening and so controls the thrust.
The boom is pressurized by a variable pitch fan. The pitch required is not a simple
function of the pedal position and never becomes negative. Instead it is a function of
how much thrust is needed. In other words the application of right or left pedal will
cause the fan pitch to increase to provide extra airﬂow to the yaw control ports. In the
case of autorotation the boom will be in upwash and the boundary layer control is no
longer effective, but nor is it needed. The fan is driven from the main rotor and yaw
control is by rotating the tail sleeve as usual.
The NOTAR system is remarkably quiet and safe and demonstration pilots have
made their point by backing the tail boom into bushes and using back cyclic so that
the machine rests on the rear of the skids and the end of the boom.
In the absence of a tail rotor to weathercock, the NOTAR machines, not surprisingly,
need a substantial amount of ﬁn area. In the production machine, minor yaw instability
is handled with a gyroscopically controlled rudder tab on one of the ﬁns. It is possible
that this is not a fundamental problem and further development may eliminate it.

5.12 Tail rotor failure
It is often overheard that loss of tail rotor drive will cause the machine to go out of
control, but this is not necessarily the case. If the tail rotor drive fails without causing
other damage and the machine is put promptly into autorotation, the torque reaction
of the main rotor will cease, and the tail rotor will be unnecessary. In some machines
the tail boom and ﬁn area are large enough to counteract engine torque by yawing
into the slipstream at reasonable translational speed and then autorotation will only
be necessary for landing. Nevertheless most pilots would rather lose the engine than
the tail rotor drive.
Unfortunately tail rotor failures can result in more than loss of drive. A failed component in the rotor can cause serious imbalance and this can tear the whole tail gearbox
out of the boom. A broken drive shaft may ﬂail and destroy hydraulics and wiring or
even sever the boom. In these cases the machine will suffer a serious forward CM shift
and a loss of rear side area. A machine with a zero-offset rotor head probably wouldn’t
retain control. Figure 5.19 shows a zero-offset helicopter that has developed a serious
nose down trim having lost its tail rotor in a collision with a ship. A machine with a
substantial tail boom and a rotor head having a wide CM tolerance would have a much
better chance.
Despite all the theory, retaining control requires the pilot to take the correct actions
and in order to take good decisions the pilot has to know the situation. In the case of
tail rotor problems the pilot cannot see what is wrong and has to deduce the problem
from whatever symptoms of vibration, noise, yaw and pitch he experiences. When this
happens suddenly it is asking a lot of the pilot to do exactly the right thing. Nevertheless
many pilots have walked away from tail rotor failure, in some cases with no further
damage to the machine.

“helic - CHAP05” — 2003/11/22 — page 189 — #24

190 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 5.19 Following a collision with a ship, this helicopter has lost its tail rotor and gearbox. Having a zerooffset rotor head, there is insufﬁcient cyclic authority to oppose the serious trim shift and the nose down attitude
that results is apparent.

Others were not so fortunate and consequently regular inspection of all components
associated with the tail rotor is to be recommended.
One point sometimes overlooked is that as the tail rotor is at the back, anything that
comes off or out of the helicopter in forward ﬂight can strike it. The designer may try
to think of every eventuality, which is why the fuel ﬁller cap is often retained by a length
of wire, but there have been cases of engine access covers coming loose in ﬂight and
inﬂicting grievous harm to the tail rotor.
Helicopters are often ﬂown with one or more doors open or removed, for ﬁlm and
television shooting, for example. In this case it is essential that everything within the
machine is ﬁxed, stowed or tethered. The helicopter with a high set tail rotor is at an
advantage here, as debris is more likely to pass below it.

Engines and transmissions
The power plant is an important component in all aircraft and no less so in helicopters.
However, helicopters necessarily have a more complicated power transmission system
than aeroplanes. In this chapter the choice of power plant is considered, along with
the operating principles of piston and turbine engines and associated transmissions.
Power plant control and instrumentation is also treated.

6.1 Introduction
The power source of a conventional helicopter must be able to drive a shaft, and
have reasonable weight and fuel consumption in relation to the power delivered. This
generally means an internal combustion engine: piston, rotary or turbine. Real engines
always turn too fast for real rotors and some reduction gearing will be needed to
transmit engine power to the various rotors and accessories. There have been some
exceptions to convention. Numerous efforts have been made to ﬁt rockets, ramjets or
turbojets directly to the blades, or even to duct gases into the blades from the hull. The
goal is to eliminate torque reaction and reduce weight. These alternatives are considered
in section 6.28.

6.2 Choice of engine
All internal combustion engines work by burning fuel in air. This raises the temperature, causing expansion which can do work. In practice more power can be obtained if
the air is compressed before the fuel burns. The turbine engine has dominated the helicopter power plant market for some time. The main advantage of the turbine is a very
high power to weight ratio. The lightness comes from simplicity; the compression of
air and the extraction of shaft power are both done by rapidly spinning blades. There
is, however, a penalty for that simplicity which is that the fast moving blades suffer
from proﬁle drag. Just keeping the blades moving consumes power. When used at high
power, the internal power loss is a small part of the overall power produced and the
turbine is efﬁcient. When used at lower power, the power lost in the blades does not
reduce in proportion and so the efﬁciency falls. Small turbine engines tend to be inefﬁcient because the Reynolds numbers at which small blades must operate will be less
favourable. As a result there are very few small turbine engines and these tend to be used
as APUs (auxiliary power units) that are only used intermittently. Although simple in
concept, the turbine engine uses highly stressed parts and the initial cost is high.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 191 — #1

192 The Art of the Helicopter
Statically compressing air with a piston in a cylinder suffers much less power loss
than dynamic means such as a turbine. This makes piston engines more efﬁcient at
partial throttle settings, hence their popularity in automotive applications. The energy
released on each power stroke is ﬁnite and so a good way of increasing the power is to
increase the RPM. The piston engine must handle the stresses raised by reciprocating
that increase with the square of the RPM.
This limits the RPM available as a function of piston size. Very small piston engines
used in models can run at over 25 000 RPM and produce an astonishing power to
weight ratio, but this cannot be scaled up because of the forces involved. Another
fundamental of piston engines is that the power available is a function of the charge
that can be admitted to the cylinder. The cylinder volume is proportional to the cube of
the bore whereas the cylinder head area, where the valves are, is only proportional to the
square of the bore. As a result the small cylinder has the advantage because not only is
the piston lighter, but more valve area is available in relation to the displacement. Thus
in piston engines there is a power to weight advantage in using a lot of small cylinders
rather than a few big ones. There is an optimum cylinder capacity for a given RPM.
The difﬁculty is that in order to produce a lot of power, a lot of cylinders are needed
and this causes practical difﬁculties in induction, exhaust, cooling and reliability, to say
nothing of cost. During World War II aircraft engines having as many as 28 cylinders
were built and these were immensely complicated.
At 400–500 kW the turbine and piston engine are about equal. For higher powers
the turbine is to be preferred, whereas for lower powers the piston engine would be
chosen. The power to weight ratio may not be as high, but if the fuel efﬁciency is good,
the saving in fuel load may more than compensate. As a result, helicopter design has
diverged into two camps. Large machines use two or three turbine engines and tend to
use high disc loading because plenty of power is available. Small machines use piston
engines and lower disc loadings.
In between the extremes there is some variability. The small single-engine turbine
helicopter cannot use high disc loading because it must be designed to autorotate well.
As a result it will not need much power and so the turbine will be heavily derated and
have poor fuel efﬁciency. Unfortunately derating an engine does not lower the cost.
Well-engineered piston machines can compete in this market simply by costing less to
purchase and less to run. Frank Robinson has demonstrated this amply with the R-44,
despite its elderly engine technology.
Unfortunately the aviation piston engine went into a period of stagnation for several
decades after the arrival of the turbine, with the result that progress in piston engine
development moved to the automotive sphere. This situation is now being remedied
and a new generation of aviation piston engines will give helicopter designers some
better solutions in light machines. In the automotive sphere fuel economy does not
drastically improve performance because the fuel load is a relatively small proportion
of the vehicle weight. In helicopters the fuel weight at take-off is limited by available
rotor thrust. Thus an improvement in fuel efﬁciency in the helicopter will translate
directly into either an increase in range for the same payload, or an increase in payload
for the same range.
The power of the gasoline engine is controlled by an induction throttle, and when
this is used, the effective compression ratio of the engine falls and with it the efﬁciency.
The induction throttle reduces the manifold pressure and this opposes the motion
of the piston during the induction stroke causing pumping loss. The power of the
Diesel engine is not controlled with a throttle. There is negligible pumping loss and
the compression ratio is always at its highest value. As only air is compressed, there is
no risk of detonation and the compression ratio can be very high indeed. This makes

the Diesel fundamentally more fuel efﬁcient than the gasoline engine as will be seen in
section 6.14. Traditionally, however, the Diesel engine has been neglected in aviation
although some Diesel powered aircraft ﬂew in World War II. The automotive industry
has dramatically improved Diesel performance in recent years and has shown that the
Diesel engine lends itself very well to turbocharging. With modern technology the
turbo-Diesel engine can equal the power of a gasoline engine for a given time between
overhaul (TBO), but with better fuel economy so that the weight of engine plus mission
fuel is actually less. Given that Diesel engines can run on AVTUR, which is signiﬁcantly
cheaper and less volatile than AVGAS, the economic and safety advantage of a Diesel
engine is signiﬁcant.

6.3 A piston-engine installation
Figure 6.1 shows the layout of the engine and transmission in a typical light pistonengine machine. Many light helicopters use an air- and oil-cooled engine originally
designed for aeroplane use in which the crankshaft will clearly be horizontal. These
typically have four cylinders arranged with a pair on each side. This arrangement is
called a ‘ﬂat four’ also known as a ‘boxer’ because the pistons on opposite sides appear
to be sparring with each other. The propeller is replaced by the cooling fan and possibly
a belt drive pulley. The cooling fan directs air through a series of bafﬂes so that it passes
round the cylinders. Some of the air is directed through the oil cooler. The centrifugal
cooling fan of the Robinson R-22 is a conspicuous feature of the machine. The Enstrom
has an axial fan.
Piston engines do not provide uniform torque because of the power impulses when
each cylinder ﬁres, and it is necessary to have some ﬂexibility in the transmission to
even out the power delivery. Even so, the transmission of a piston-engine helicopter has
to be stronger to withstand the ﬂuctuating torque. The use of anti-vibration technology
in the drive train to smooth out the power impulses of piston engines with torsional
tuned ﬁlters is in its infancy. Currently, ﬂexibility in the drive train may be provided
by using a belt drive and by mounting the engine on rubber blocks. The belts used are
reinforced with polyester chords and have a tapering cross-section intended to run in
vee-shaped grooves in the pulleys. Belt tension wedges the belt into the groove so that

Fig. 6.1 The drive train arrangement used in a number of light piston-engine helicopters including Robinson,
Enstrom and Schweizer models. The piston engine drives a cooling fan and a belt pulley. The belt drives a shaft
between the main and tail gearboxes. The upper pulley contains a one-way clutch to allow the rotors to turn if
the engine fails.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 193 — #3

194 The Art of the Helicopter
slipping will not occur. Machines vary in detail; the Robinson uses two double-vee
belts, the Schweizer uses eight single belts, and the Enstrom uses a single Poly-vee belt
about six inches wide. Belts can last as long as ﬁve years, but ﬂying in dusty conditions
causes more rapid wear.
The belt drive commonly does duty as the clutch. By slackening the belt tension, the
engine can be started and warmed up without the rotors turning. When the engine is
warm the belt tension is applied gradually so that the belt can slip in order to spin up
the rotors smoothly. Once the rotors are up to engine speed the full ﬂight tension can be
applied. Starting the engine with the clutch engaged should never be attempted. In the
Robinson the starter is powerful enough to turn engine and rotors, but when the engine
ﬁres the sudden speed increase could damage the main rotor blades. In an Enstrom
the rotor blades are heavy and articulated and instead the result would probably be a
burned-out starter.
The belt tensioning is performed in various ways. In the Robinson the shaft between
the main and tail rotors is supported near the pulleys by a bearing that can be raised
and lowered by a small electric gear motor. The ﬂexible couplings in the shaft allow
this movement. The belt tension is measured and the motor can only run until the correct tension is achieved. Some care is needed when operating the motor switch; rapid
engagement will stall the engine. In the Enstrom the belt is tensioned by bringing in a
jockey pulley against the ﬂat outer side of the belt. This is mechanically operated by
cable from a lever in the cockpit. When the drive is fully engaged a system of links passes
over centre and maintains belt tension with no tension in the cable. In this system the
pilot has better control of the clutch engagement force. In the Schweizer the belts are
tightened by pulling out an idler pulley with a steel wire driven by a servo motor. The
wire is permanently in tension. In all of these machines, the upper belt pulley drives
the long shaft joining the main rotor gearbox and the tail rotor gearbox.
The pulley on the gearbox shaft has a one-way clutch inside it so that the engine can
drive the shaft but the shaft cannot drive the engine. If the engine fails, or, worse still,
siezes, the rotors can still turn freely so that an autorotation can be performed.

6.4 A turbine installation
As will be seen in section 6.19, turbine engines are found in two types. In the ﬁrst
there is only one rotating assembly and this is integral with the output shaft. No
starting clutch is necessary because the starter motor spins the turbine and the rotor.
In the preferred type of turbine engine there are two power turbines. The ﬁrst generates
shaft power to turn the compressor. The second turbine develops shaft power to drive
the helicopter. Engines of this type are called free turbine engines because there is
no mechanical connection between the ﬁrst part of the engine, which is essentially a
gas generator, and the second part that converts gas energy to shaft power. The gas
generator may be spun with the starter motor even though the free turbine is locked by
a rotor brake. In this way the engine can be started without the rotors turning. If the
brake is released and the power is increased, the rotors will run up smoothly. The free
turbine engine also has the advantage that the rotors can be stopped without stopping
the engine. The turbine is set to idle power and produces minimal torque at the free
turbine. The rotor can be stopped with the rotor brake.
The turbine itself is light and often mounted on or in the roof of the hull. Figure 6.2(a)
shows the arrangement in the JetRanger. The power turbine gear train, through the
autorotation clutch, drives the tail rotor shaft to the rear and the main rotor shaft to the
front. The main rotor gearbox is resiliently mounted and the drive shaft is ﬁtted with

machine. The tail rotor will be driven from the main rotor transmission.

two constant velocity joints to allow relative motion of the gearbox and the engine. In
some machines the turbine drives only the main transmission as in Figure 6.2(b). In
many machines twin engines are installed. In this case a pair of autorotation clutches
is needed, one for each engine. Then either engine can fail and the remaining engine
drives the transmission. The tail rotor drive must also come from the transmission.

6.5 Correlators and governors
The RRPM determines the rate of response to the controls and must be kept constant.
It was shown in Chapter 3 that the power needed to drive the rotors at constant speed
varies considerably with the attitude and ﬂight regime. Governors and correlators are
devices intended to make control of the throttle more or less automatic so that the pilot
has less to do. The governor is a system using negative feedback to adapt the power

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 195 — #5

196 The Art of the Helicopter
setting to the load placed on the engine. In contrast the correlator is a device using
feedforward to predict the power setting necessary from the position of the collective
lever. This may be done mechanically with a shaped cam on the collective linkage. The
cam shape is obtained during tests of the prototype. Feedforward may also be applied
electrically, in which case the collective lever is ﬁtted with a position sensor. A correlator
only gives an approximate control of RRPM since the position of the collective lever is
only one factor affecting the power required. There is, for example, no compensation
for air density or the degree of inﬂow through the rotor.
The gasoline engine is literally throttled to control its power. The induction passage is
restricted and this is a stable process. If the engine speeds up, the pressure drop across
the constriction will increase, dropping the induction pressure. If the engine slows
down, the pressure drop across the constriction will decrease, increasing the induction pressure. Thus on a piston-engine helicopter governors are not essential and most
machines just have a correlator. One school of thought suggests that it is better to learn
to ﬂy an uncorrelated machine because by manipulating the throttle a more thorough
understanding of the power needed in different conditions is obtained.
Neither the turbine nor the Diesel has a throttle because the induction system is fully
open at all times. As a result these types of engine will not hold their RPM unaided
and a governor is essential. The governor is a system that compares the desired speed
with the actual speed and uses the speed error to operate the power control to apply a
correction. This is an example of negative feedback as described in Chapter 2.
The principle of the governor goes back to the ﬁrst steam engines. In the centrifugal
governor shown in Figure 6.3 a pair of weights are attached to a shaft driven by the
engine such that they will ﬂy out as speed increases. This is arranged to reduce the
power so a set speed cannot be exceeded. The speed is set by a change to the spring
tension applied to the linkage. If the spring tension is increased this tends to increase
the power and the weights have to spin faster before they can produce enough force to
reduce power.
In practice the engine revs will not be held perfectly stable because if more power is
demanded the power control must be operated to provide it. The engine RPM must
reduce slightly in order to create an error. Figure 6.4(a) shows that this is known as
static droop. Static droop can be reduced by increasing the amount of power control
movement for a given speed error. This effectively changes the gain applied to the speed

Fig. 6.3 The centrifugal governor is a very simple device as it relies on rotating weights being thrown outwards
as speed increases.

(c)

Fig. 6.4 (a) Following a ﬁxed increase in power demand due to, for example, an increase in collective pitch,
the RRPM may fall, because the feedback loop needs an error to increase power. This static droop can be
eliminated using feedforward. (b) An input from the collective lever is used to anticipate approximately the
amount of power needed. The feedback system then has to make smaller power corrections that it can do with
a smaller RRPM error. (c) Transient droop due to the time needed for the gas generator to increase speed.

difference of the system. Increasing the gain will allow tighter control of speed but it
also increases the chance that the system will become unstable so that it swings between
too fast and too slow without stabilizing. A better solution is to combine governing and
correlating systems so that there is both feedback and feedforward. Figure 6.4(b) shows
how this is done. The power setting is determined by the sum of two signals. One of
these is the feedforward signal from the collective lever. This provides approximately the
right power setting. The second signal is the RRPM error feedback from the governor
that slightly adapts the power setting to minimize the speed error. As most of the power
setting is provided by the feedforward signal, the static droop will be minimal.
Piston engines are geared to the rotor and so run at near-constant RPM. The power
delivered is changed with a change of torque and with a naturally aspirated engine this
can be done instantly by adjusting the throttle or, in the case of a Diesel, changing

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 197 — #7

198 The Art of the Helicopter
the amount of fuelling. This does not happen in a free turbine engine where only the
power turbine is geared to the rotor. Instead, greater power will be supplied by an
increase in the gas generator speed (N1 ) that delivers greater torque at the free turbine.
N1 cannot increase immediately. It takes time for the spool to accelerate. As a result
there will be a temporary loss of RRPM during the time taken to spool up. This is
known as transient droop. Figure 6.4(c) shows transient droop following a step change
in power demand. Turbocharged piston engines will also display transient droop as the
turbocharger accelerates.
Transient droop may be reduced through sensing the collective lever velocity. During
a landing, collective will be lowered and this will cause the gas generator to spool down.
If the landing is to be rejected, the pilot will pull the collective lever up. A system sensing
collective velocity will be able to start spooling up sooner than one which simply waits
for the lever to come up to provide power demand.
If the collective lever is raised too far on a turbine machine, the result will be an
overtorque condition as the governor maintains RRPM. However, on a piston-engine
helicopter once the throttle is fully open, further application of collective will cause
overpitching. Induced drag causes a reduction in RRPM. In a machine with a manual
throttle the correct recovery from overpitching is to maintain full throttle and to reduce
collective pitch momentarily to regain rotor speed. If such a machine were ﬁtted with a
correlator the act of lowering the collective pitch lever could reduce the throttle setting
and delay the RRPM recovery. The operation of a governor would not be impaired
because a reduction in RRPM would result in a large speed error that would fully
open the throttle. In the optional governor system of the Robinson R-22 the throttle
is controlled by a governor mechanism responding to RRPM. However, an additional
system is ﬁtted which prevents overpitching. If the throttle is wide open to recover
RRPM but the rotor speed fails to respond, an additional servo motor reduces the
collective pitch setting until the speed error has been reduced. The collective servo
linkage is ﬁtted with a slipping clutch so that in the case of a failure the pilot can
override it. The ﬁrst use of a mechanism to maintain rotor speed by lowering collective
was by Flettner in the 282 Kolibri.
In practice a free turbine engine needs two governors, one for the gas generator spool
and one for the power turbine. These will be part of the fuel control system. Either of
them can limit the turbine fuelling to prevent overspeeding. The gas generator governor
is used for starting, idling and shutdown, and is controlled by the throttle lever in the
cockpit. For ﬂight, the throttle lever is set to maximum so that gas generator RPM is
no longer able to restrict fuelling. This results in acceleration of the gas generator spool
and increased gas ﬂow that brings the rotors up to ﬂight RPM. The rotor speed is then
controlled using the power turbine governor which limits fuelling as correct RRPM is
reached.

6.6 The gasoline engine
The piston engine is now over 100 years old but modern designs still work in the same
way as the machine built by von Otto.
Figure 6.5 shows a section through a typical horizontally opposed piston engine.
The pistons slide to and fro inside the cylinders and they are joined to the rotating
crankshaft by connecting rods. The connecting rods, generally abbreviated to con rods,
must be able to swivel in the pistons, and this is the function of the gudgeon pin, which
passes through the little end of the con rod. The other end of the con rod must have a
larger bearing in it to ﬁt around the strong crankpin. In the boxer engine the crankshaft

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 198 — #8

Engines and transmissions 199

Fig. 6.5 A typical horizontally opposed aircraft engine in section. See text for details.

is constructed so that the pistons all move in and out simultaneously. The reaction due
to accelerating the piston on one side is then balanced by that from the other side and
vibration is reduced. The cylinders are not precisely opposite one another to give room
for the crank web.
The large bearing in the connecting rod is called the big end. The aluminium pistons
have slots ﬁtted with rings which are springy metal strips. These press outwards against
the cylinder wall and ensure a good pressure seal. In a piston engine four distinct stages
are needed in the complete cycle, and in the four stroke or Otto cycle engine, the piston
traverses the cylinder four times, which requires two revolutions of the crankshaft.
The cylinder head is ﬁtted with valves allowing fresh charge to enter the cylinder and
burned charge, or exhaust, to leave. The valves are operated by a camshaft ﬁtted above
the crankshaft. This carries a series of rounded bumps called lobes. As the camshaft
turns, each lobe presses against the ﬂat end of a small piston-like object known as a
tappet. In the tappet there is a swivel joint that connects to the push rod. This travels
in a tube up the outside of the cylinder to a rocker in the cylinder head that pushes the
valve open. When the cam lobe retreats, the valve is closed by the valve springs, which
also push back the rocker, the pushrod and the tappet. When the valve is closed there
must be a little slack in the pushrod, known as valve clearance, so that the whole spring
pressure is keeping the valve shut.
Since the full four strokes require two crankshaft revolutions, the camshaft is driven
through a 2 : 1 reduction gear so the sequence of valve openings resulting from one
camshaft rotation is spread over the two crankshaft revolutions. On the intake stroke,
the inlet valve is opened and charge is drawn into the cylinder. On the compression
stroke both valves are closed and the charge is squeezed into the remaining space above
the piston. On the power stroke, pairs of spark plugs ignite the charge, and it burns and
expands, driving down the piston and turning the crankshaft. On the exhaust stroke, the
exhaust valve opens and the piston pushes out the spent charge. The cycle then repeats.
In practice momentum of the gases means that the valves operate at a slightly different
time than this simple explanation would indicate. Figure 6.6 shows a typical valvetiming diagram. During the induction stroke the charge entering through the inlet
manifold is travelling at high speed and cannot stop easily. The inlet valve is left open
until after bottom dead centre (BDC). Momentum will continue to force charge into
the cylinder so that extra charge can be admitted allowing more power to be generated.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 199 — #9

200 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.6 A valve-timing diagram. Owing to the inertia of moving gases, the valve timing may be adapted to
obtain better mass ﬂow. Note the overlap at the end of the exhaust stroke where exhaust momentum is used to
draw fresh charge into the cylinder.

The exhaust valve opens before BDC so that the exhaust can start to accelerate out
of the cylinder in time for the exhaust stroke. The exhaust gases leave at high speed, and
at the end of the exhaust stroke the momentum of the gases will carry them onwards
even when the cylinder is empty. This causes a reduction in pressure in the cylinder.
The inlet valve is opened before the exhaust valve closes so that the momentum of the
exhaust leaving will pull fresh charge in. This is known as valve overlap. Racing engines
use camshafts having a lot of valve overlap to help charge transfer at high speed. This
makes them very rough at lower speeds. Helicopter engines are required to have good
throttle response over a limited RPM range rather than ultimate power, and will be
ﬁtted with milder camshafts.
The valve mechanism in early engines required an adjustment to take up slack in the
pushrod as wear took place. A small clearance was left to allow the parts to expand
without the valves being pushed open when they were supposed to be shut. If the valve
clearance was excessive the valves would not open for as long, and power would be
reduced. The mechanism would make a lot of noise. Tappet adjustment was frequently
required to maintain performance.
In later engines a self-adjusting mechanism was devised. The tappet contains a small
piston that drives the pushrod. Engine oil pressure is communicated to the tappet
through a small drilling so that the piston will move until it has taken up the slack in

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 200 — #10

Engines and transmissions 201

the valve train. When the camshaft opens the valve, the force is transmitted through
the oil pressure. The drilling is too small to allow a signiﬁcant amount of oil to be
forced back out of the tappet. Hydraulic tappets are self-adjusting and the periodic
maintenance is eliminated.

6.7 The ignition system
Ignition of the charge is achieved by the generation of a spark between a pair of electrodes in the cylinder head. A very high voltage is needed to break down the insulation
of the compressed charge so that a spark can occur. The high voltages present in ignition
systems cause stress to the components, and as a result the ignition system is probably
the least reliable part of the engine. This is overcome in aircraft engines by having a
completely duplicated ignition system. There are even two spark plugs per cylinder,
one for each ignition system. This also allows a small increase in power because the
charge is ignited in two places at once.
In cars, the high ignition voltage is generated by an induction coil driven by the
electrical system. If the electrical supply is cut off the engine stops. This is not reliable
enough for aircraft, and these use an alternative system that generates its own electricity directly from engine shaft power using a rotating magnet. This magneto-dynamic
ignition unit is invariably known by the abbreviation of magneto. In a magneto system
the engine will keep running even if the electrical system of the helicopter has totally
failed. A pair of magnetos are ﬁtted on the back of an aircraft engine, driven by the
gear cluster that drives the camshaft and the oil and fuel pumps. When the aircraft
engine is mounted backwards in a helicopter, the magnetos can be found adjacent to
the cockpit ﬁrewall.
The principle of operation of the magneto is based on the same physics as electricity
generation. When current ﬂows through a coil of wire, it generates a magnetic ﬁeld. The
ﬁeld can be ampliﬁed by winding the coil around a soft iron core. If the magnetic ﬁeld
passing through a coil is constant, there is no effect, but if the ﬁeld changes, a voltage
proportional to the rate of change of ﬂux is induced. The two phenomena described
above combine to give a coil the property of inductance. An inductor is a sort of magnetic ﬂywheel. A mechanical ﬂywheel stores kinetic energy proportional to the square
of the speed. An inductor stores magnetic energy proportional to the square of the
current. In the same way that a ﬂywheel resists changes of speed, an inductor resists
changes of current.
Imagine an inductor with a current ﬂowing through it. If some external resistance
attempts to reduce the current, the magnetic ﬂux in the coil is reduced. The falling ﬂux
induces a voltage in the coil that attempts to increase the current. On the other hand
if something attempts to increase the current, the magnetic ﬂux will increase, and the
change of ﬂux in the opposite direction will induce a voltage that opposes the current.
As a result the inductor tries to keep the current passing through constant.
Figure 6.7 shows the construction of a magneto. The input shaft turns at camshaft
speed and carries a powerful permanent magnet. As the magnet turns its magnetic ﬁeld
passes through stationary poles in alternate directions. Around one of the poles is a
winding of thick copper wire. The ends of this coil can be shorted out by a pair of
contacts, known as points, operated by a cam on the input shaft. A capacitor is ﬁtted
across the points that are closed when the magnet ﬂux in the stationary pole is changing
from one direction to the other. The changing ﬂux induces a voltage in the coil, but the
coil is shorted out so there is very little resistance. The coil builds up a high current at
a rate determined by the inductance.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 201 — #11

202 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.7 The magneto generates its own electricity and so is potentially more reliable than an ignition system
using the aircraft’s electrical supply.

When maximum current is reached, the cam opens the contacts. The inductance
attempts to keep the current ﬂowing, but it cannot pass the open points. The only place
the current can go is through the capacitor. As the capacitor charges up, the current
reduces. This reduces the inductor ﬂux and increases the induced voltage. When the
current ﬁnally stops ﬂowing, the capacitor is charged to a high voltage. The magnetic
energy has been exchanged for electrical energy stored in the capacitor. The voltage on
the capacitor now reverses the current, which builds up in the inductance. The current
keeps ﬂowing after the capacitor voltage has fallen to zero and charges the capacitor up
in the reverse direction. The inductor and capacitor form a resonant circuit where the
energy repeatedly exchanges between the inductor and the capacitor and an alternating
current ﬂows in the windings. The same effect is achieved mechanically in a tuning fork.
As the capacitor is quite small, the frequency of oscillation is quite high, and the rate
at which the current changes is also high. Thus a high rate of ﬂux change is achieved in
the inductor. A secondary coil consisting of many turns of ﬁne wire is wound on top of
the ﬁrst coil. The rapidly alternating ﬂux induces a very high alternating voltage in the
secondary coil, and this results in a rapid succession of sparks at the plug electrodes.
The sparks continue until the magnetic energy is dissipated. In a multi-cylinder engine,
this high tension (HT) current is directed to the appropriate cylinder by a rotary switch
called a distributor on the end of the shaft. There is no mechanical contact in the
distributor; the metal parts come close enough for the HT to jump across the gap, so
in fact there are two sparks in series, one at the plug and one at the distributor.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 202 — #12

Engines and transmissions 203

The capacitor is a vital part of the system, because without it the current would
have nowhere to go when the points open, and most of the magnetic energy would be
dissipated in a spark at the points, which would then be rapidly eroded away. The spark
in the cylinder would then be very weak. This can happen if the capacitor becomes
disconnected or fails open circuit. If the capacitor fails short circuit the points are
bypassed, and no spark will be produced at all. This type of failure is rare.
The HT wiring to the spark plugs needs to be well insulated so that the HT does
not jump to the nearest piece of metal instead of going to the plug. At high altitude
the reduced air pressure reduces the insulating ability of the air, and as a result the
ignition leads must have somewhat better insulation than those found in cars. Part of
the pre-ﬂight check is an inspection of the condition of the HT leads. Needless to say
they should not be touched when the engine is running.
Whilst the magneto has the advantage that it is completely independent of the helicopter’s electrical system, it does suffer from one disadvantage. When starting, the
engine speed is low, and the rate of change of ﬂux in the magneto will be correspondingly low and a poor spark results. One solution to this problem is a device known
as an impulse coupling which is basically a torsion spring in the magneto drive shaft.
The presence of the permanent magnet makes the torque needed to rotate the magneto
vary with the angle of rotation. This can easily be demonstrated by attempting to turn
a bicycle dynamo by hand. At starting speed, when the torque is large, the spring in the
impulse coupling is wound up as the magneto lags behind the shaft. As the torque falls,
the spring tension is released, and the magneto is temporarily turned faster than the
shaft. This allows a larger spark to be generated. A further use of the impulse coupling
is that the lag delays the time at which the spark is generated. Under normal conditions,
the spark is supplied a little before top dead centre (TDC) in order to allow the charge
time to start burning before the power stroke. At low starting RPM, the advanced
spark might cause the engine to kick back, or ﬁre during the compression stroke. The
delay of the impulse coupling prevents this happening. At normal operating speed the
torsion spring does not have time to twist and the magneto runs at constant speed with
the correct timing.
Dual ignition systems are provided to increase the reliability of the engine. This
reliability increase is only present if both ignition systems are working properly. Part of
the pre-ﬂight check is to test the ignition system. This is done using the ignition switch.
As the magneto is self-contained, the only way it can be switched off is by shorting
out the points. The ignition switch is connected across the points and the magneto
is switched off by closing the ignition switch contacts. This is a safer approach since
a broken wire from the ignition switch will not stop the engine. The ignition switch
is constructed so that either or both magnetos can be switched on. In aircraft the
ignition switch may have a further position to operate the starter, but this is not used in
helicopters. Instead the starter button is ﬁtted on the end of the collective lever where
it may be operated by the pilot without letting go of the controls.
When the engine is warm, the dual ignition may be tested. At a speciﬁed RPM, the
ignition switch is turned from ‘both’ to ‘left’. This disables the right magneto. The
result should be a slight reduction in RPM, known as a magneto drop, because only
one spark is being generated per cylinder. The drop is normally that which is measured
after 5 seconds running on one magneto. The engine is run on both systems again for
a short time to clear any fouling which may have built up on the plugs whilst they were
out of use. The switch is then set to ‘right’, when an identical drop should be obtained.
If the drops are grossly different or do not occur, there is a problem which must be
rectiﬁed before ﬂight.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 203 — #13

204 The Art of the Helicopter
To take an example, if on switching from ‘both’ to ‘left’ there is no drop, either the
right magneto was not working or it has not been switched off due to a broken wire.
Switching to ‘right’ will show which. If the engine cuts, the right magneto is inoperative.
If a drop is obtained, the right magneto is permanently on due to a wiring fault. This
can be proved by switching off the ignition. If the engine continues to run, the wire to
the ignition switch is broken. The engine can be stopped by the idle cut-off as normal.
If the drops are not identical, one ignition system is working better than the other for
some reason. If only an RPM loss is noted, the different drop could be due to a timing
difference between the magnetos. If one magneto gives a larger drop and a misﬁre,
consideration should be given to the possibility of a failed spark plug or capacitor or
a fractured HT lead.
The cylinders are numbered from what would be the front in an aircraft, which in a
helicopter corresponds to being numbered away from the drive pulley. In a Lycoming
engine mounted back to front in a helicopter, the odd numbered cylinders are on the
port side. The sequence of power strokes is designed to reduce torsional stress in the
crankshaft by ﬁring cylinder pairs alternately. This gives the ﬁring order of 1-3-2-4.

6.8 The starter
The starter is basically a powerful electric motor used to turn the engine. A reduction
gearing system is needed so that the starter can develop enough torque to overcome
the engine compression. A small pinion on the starter engages with a large ring gear
on the engine ﬂywheel. The gears are only engaged during starting. This can be done
by a helical thread mechanism that screws the pinion along the motor shaft or by a
solenoid that slides it. In the latter type a one-way clutch prevents the engine driving
the starter. Recently geared starter motors have become available. These have a high
speed electric motor and a reduction gearbox and are lighter than conventional starters
and consume less current. The weight saving may be compounded because they allow
a smaller battery and thinner wiring to be used.
The motor must be quite powerful, and it will require a current of several hundred
amperes to operate it. In order to minimize power loss in the cables, these run direct
from the battery to the motor. This current is beyond the capability of a switch, and a
relay is used. The starter button on the collective lever switches a small current through
a solenoid coil, and this attracts the solenoid armature, sliding the starter gear into
engagement with the ﬂywheel and pulling the main motor contacts closed. Normally
the starter motor gear is driven through a one-way clutch so that it can run at high
speed when the engine ﬁres without damaging the starter motor. A warning light is
ﬁtted which should go out if the starter button is released. If it does not the starter may
still be engaged.
If the starter fails to operate, this could indicate a faulty solenoid. It is generally
possible to hear the solenoid operating. If the solenoid chatters or vibrates this indicates
a loose battery connection or a discharged battery.
The starter motor dissipates a lot of heat when starting, and if the engine does not
start promptly because it is ﬂooded or vapour locked, prolonged cranking will ﬂatten
the battery and overheat the starter motor. It is better to allow a cooling period between
starting attempts than to burn out the starter motor. The starter motor should never
be operated when the engine is running as engaging the starter pinion with the fast
turning gear on the ﬂywheel could remove teeth. The engine must be allowed to come
to a complete halt before making a further starting attempt.

6.9 The oil system
The oil system is responsible for lubrication and cooling of the moving parts of the
engine. Heavy forces are involved in the connecting rods and crankshaft bearings, and
if metal-to-metal contact took place the life of the parts would be very short. Oil
possesses viscosity, which is a resistance to ﬂow. If viscous oil is pumped between two
surfaces it can carry a load without them touching because the viscosity resists the oil
being squeezed out. The relative movement of the surfaces causes shearing of the oil.
Shearing a viscous liquid develops heat, and this heat load adds to the heat picked up
where the oil is used to cool parts of the engine. An oil cooler is necessary to control
the oil temperature.
Figure 6.8 shows a typical engine oil system. Oil is held in the sump below the engine.
The sump contains a ﬁller neck whose cap holds a dipstick so the oil level can be checked.
This should be done before ﬂight. Oil is drawn from the sump through a strainer to
prevent particles of dirt from damaging the pump. The pump may consist of a pair
of meshing gears driven from the camshaft/magneto drive cluster at the rear of the
engine. The capacity of the pump exceeds the requirements of the engine, and surplus
oil is returned to the sump by a spring-loaded relief valve that opens when the correct

Fig. 6.8 Lubrication system for a typical piston engine. See text for details.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 205 — #15

206 The Art of the Helicopter
oil pressure is reached. The oil then passes through a ﬁlter that removes microscopic
particles of metal due to engine wear and combustion products that have found their
way past the piston rings into the oil. The ﬁlter needs to be replaced periodically. If the
ﬁlter becomes clogged, a spring-loaded valve opens allowing oil to bypass the ﬁlter.
The oil next passes to the oil cooler. This is a small heat exchanger that is often ﬁtted
in the engine cooling bafﬂes so that it gets a cold air feed from the engine driven fan.
The cooler is bypassed by a thermostatic valve that is open at low temperatures to allow
the oil to warm up quickly. The valve can also be forced open by oil pressure if the
cooler blocks up. At the outlet of the cooler the oil is ready to be fed to the engine. At
this point the oil pressure and temperature are monitored and displayed on gauges in
the cockpit. Some of the oil is fed to the main crankshaft bearings. The crankshaft is
hollow and oil is pumped in from the main bearings and ﬂows to lubricate the big ends.
The connecting rods may also be hollow and oil carries on up the rods to lubricate
the little end. An oil jet is drilled in the top of the connecting rod to spray oil on the
piston for cooling and to lubricate the cylinder wall. Oil is also supplied to the camshaft
bearings and the valve mechanism as well as to the gear train driving the camshaft and
the magnetos. The oil will eventually fall back into the sump.
The engine oil has a ﬁnite life primarily because it builds up an increasing load
of acids, which are by-products of combustion, and water from condensation. Oil is
characterized by its viscosity. Viscosity is measured by the time taken in seconds for
a standard quantity of oil to ﬂow through an oriﬁce standardized by the Society of
Automotive Engineers (SAE) at a standard temperature. Oil may also be classiﬁed by
a commercial aviation number that is twice the SAE number.
The viscosity of oil falls with increasing temperature. So-called multi-grade oils have
a smaller viscosity loss with temperature. The correct viscosity of oil is essential and
it must be used at the correct temperature. If the oil is too viscous or used at too low
a temperature, it may not ﬂow readily to all the necessary parts of the engine. If the
oil is too thin or used at too great a temperature, it may be squeezed from bearings
and permit contact. The engine oil must be warmed up before ﬂight so that correct
lubrication is achieved when full power is demanded.
The ﬂight manual will specify the viscosity of oil that must be used in temperate
conditions. A mandatory placard on the machine adjacent to the ﬁller will state the
viscosity needed. If the machine is consistently operated at elevated ambient temperatures, it may not be possible to keep the oil down to the required temperature. In this
case thicker oil will be used which will thin down to the right viscosity at the elevated
temperature. In a similar way if the machine is to be used in cold conditions the oil
may run too cold and thinner oil will be speciﬁed to get the right viscosity at a lower
temperature. It is important that the oil level is checked regularly and kept topped up
with the same type of oil. Oil grades should not be mixed and it is better not to mix
brands. Oils contain a host of additives to improve performance and sometimes the
additives in one kind of oil react with those in another. Turbine engines need oil with
different additives and viscosity. Turbine oil cannot be used in piston engines.
The oil pressure and temperature gauges tell a great deal about the health and working
conditions of the engine and should be monitored regularly as part of the pre-ﬂight
check and whilst airborne. On starting the engine, it may take some time for oil pressure
to be established as the oil is cold and thick and the pump has difﬁculty dragging it from
the sump. Expect the delay to be longer in cold conditions. Generally if oil pressure has
not established in 30 seconds the engine should be shut down and the cause investigated.
When cold the oil resists ﬂowing through the engine and once pressure is established
the pump has no difﬁculty supplying enough pressure. Paradoxically, once the pressure has established, it may become excessive in cold conditions or if using straight

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 206 — #16

Engines and transmissions 207

(non-multi-grade) oil in a new engine. In this case the engine revs must be kept to a
minimum after starting until the oil has warmed up. Another cause of excessive oil
pressure at idle is if the relief valve has stuck. In any case of excess pressure, engine revs
must not be increased as a further increase in pressure could burst the oil ﬁlter or the
cooler.
In a hot engine the oil ﬂows more freely and worn bearings will increase the oil ﬂow.
At idle speed the oil pump may not be able to meet the ﬂow demand and the pressure
will fall. Thus low oil pressure with hot idle may indicate bearing wear.
After a cold start, the engine should be run on the ground until the oil temperature
has reached a minimum level for ﬂight. If it takes an excessive time for this temperature
to be reached the thermostatic valve in the oil cooler could be stuck and making the
cooler work continuously.
Sudden and total loss of oil pressure in ﬂight is rare and will be due to a mechanical
failure such as a sheared pump drive or a burst pipe. The engine will be destroyed
unless it is shut down immediately. If a suitable landing site is available, the engine
should be stopped and an autorotating landing will be needed. A conscious decision
to autorotate is safer than trying to land using power because without oil the engine
could sieze up without warning and this might occur in the avoid curve. If no suitable
forced landing site is near, it will be necessary to sacriﬁce the engine in order to attempt
to ﬂy to safety. Flying at minimum power speed will buy time.
A more likely fault situation in ﬂight is where the oil temperature slowly rises and
the oil pressure slowly falls. This is an indication of oil loss due to a leak or oil being
burned in the cylinders. A landing should be made promptly so that an investigation
can be made.
When assessing the oil pressure and temperature gauges, the stress the machine has
been under should be considered. Following a lengthy climb at maximum all up weight
(MAUW) one might expect hot engine oil. The stress on the machine would be reﬂected
in elevated transmission oil temperature and cylinder head temperature. If all of these
readings are high, the machine is being driven hard and should be ﬂown in a way that
will reduce the power requirements.
On landing the engine should be run at idle for a short while in order to cool it. If
this is not done oil inside the engine will be exposed to heat that it cannot carry away
and the oil could be carbonized and lose effectiveness. This is known as heat soak.

6.10 The carburettor
Engines produce power by burning charge. The purpose of the carburettor is to mix air
and fuel to create charge. Charge will burn over the following range of fuel/air mixes.
A ratio of 1 part fuel to 8 parts air is called a rich mixture, and not all the fuel will
be burned. A ratio of 1:20 is called a lean mixture and not all of the oxygen will be
burned. A ratio of about 1:12 is called a stoichiometric ratio as there is just enough
fuel to combine with all the oxygen.
Clearly a chemically accurate ratio will give the most power and a lean mixture will
give the best fuel economy. Unfortunately it is not possible to take full advantage of this
because of a number of practical considerations. At high power the engine temperature
cannot be kept at a safe level unless a rich mixture is used. The surplus fuel absorbs
heat by evaporation.
The four-stroke engine compresses the charge before combustion to increase the
power output. The greater the compression ratio, the more power can be released.
When charge is ignited it should proceed to burn smoothly as a ﬂame front travelling

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 207 — #17

208 The Art of the Helicopter
away from the spark plug. Unfortunately when charge is compressed the temperature
will be raised and it can detonate instantly when ignited. This causes a rapid pressure
step that creates shock waves travelling through the engine. A metallic ringing noise
called ‘pinking’ or knock can be heard. If sustained, engine damage will result.
The ability of a fuel to resist detonation must be matched to the compression ratio of
the engine it will be used in. The detonation resistance of fuel is measured in a special
variable compression test engine. The fuel under test is used to drive the engine and
the compression is increased until detonation commences. The engine is then run on
iso-octane, a relatively detonation resistant hydrocarbon, and this is steadily diluted
with heptane, a detonation prone fuel, until detonation commences. The percentage
of octane at which this takes place is the octane number of the fuel. Since the test was
devised, more detonation resistant fuels have been developed, and the scale has been
extended above 100 by extrapolation.
Using fuel of inadequate octane number for the engine causes damage through detonation. The machine carries mandatory placards adjacent to the fuel ﬁllers stating the
octane number of the fuel that must be used.
A rich mixture helps to prevent detonation by reducing the temperature increase
during compression. Fuels are often speciﬁed by two octane numbers; the second is
for a rich mixture. For example, many piston helicopters burn 100/130 LL fuel. At
normal mixtures this is 100 octane, but at full rich mixture it is 130 octane. LL stands
for low lead. In the 1920s it was discovered that the addition of tetra-ethyl lead to
fuel increased the octane number. Decades later it was proved that the resultant lead
pollution was slowing the rate of brain development of children living near busy roads
and less damaging alternatives have had to be found.
Whilst fuel of inadequate octane rating causes damage, occasional use of higher
octane fuel is acceptable. Prolonged use of high octane fuel may result in spark plugs
being fouled by the octane-boosting additives. No power increase will be observed
because the power output is determined by the engine design, particularly the compression ratio.
The carburettor has to mix the air and fuel in the chosen proportion. Figure 6.9 shows
that it is a fairly simple device. Engine power is controlled by throttle (3): a disc that
pivots in the intake tract. With the throttle wide open, the pressure in the inlet manifold
will be nearly atmospheric, whereas with the throttle closed down to the idle position,
the manifold pressure will be near zero. Manifold pressure is displayed on a gauge in the
cockpit as it indicates the proportion of maximum power the engine is producing. The
pilot needs to know how much reserve power is necessary before committing himself
to a manoeuvre needing higher power: a procedure called a power check.
The result of throttling the engine is to reduce the ﬂow of air through the carburettor.
The fuel ﬂow must remain proportional to the mass ﬂow. This is done by the creation
of a small constriction or venturi in the inlet tract. The air must go faster through the
smaller cross-section. This increases the dynamic pressure of the air. As the static and
dynamic pressures sum to a constant, the static pressure must reduce, as described by
Bernoulli’s theory. The reduction in static pressure causes a pressure difference across
the fuel in the carburettor body making it ﬂow through a metering oriﬁce or jet (2) and
mix with the air. Clearly the depth of fuel could affect the pressure and the carburettor
has a ﬂoat valve (1) that admits fuel as it is used to prevent the level falling.
The system is self-balancing, because greater airﬂow causes greater suction at the
venturi and increases the fuel ﬂow. If the throttle is opened suddenly, the fuel inertia
prevents a rapid increase in fuel delivery and the mixture will weaken momentarily.
Weakening is prevented by the action of a small pump (4) that produces a jet of fuel
when the throttle is opened quickly.

(b)

Fig. 6.9 The carburettor is a simple device which uses a venturi to create a pressure drop that will suck fuel
from a jet. The jet may be variable (a) for mixture control, or this may be done by air bleed changing the pressure
exerted on the fuel (b).

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 209 — #19

210 The Art of the Helicopter
When the engine is at idle, the throttle will nearly be closed. The minimum throttle
opening is set by throttle stop screw that prevents the engine inadvertently being
stopped. With the throttle closed the airﬂow through the venturi is very small and
insufﬁcient to draw fuel. As the throttle disc reaches the closed position it admits low
manifold pressure to a drilling in the side of the tract. This draws fuel from the ﬂoat
chamber through the idle jet (5), and air from the idle mixture screw (6). In effect a
miniature carburettor is created to handle the small charge ﬂow at idle.
As altitude increases, the air density falls but the fuel density doesn’t. The carburettor tends to produce a richer mixture than necessary. This is overcome by ﬁtting a
mixture control. There are two ways of controlling the mixture. In the ﬁrst, shown in
Figure 6.9(a), a needle valve (8) is placed in series with the main jet and changes the
resistance to fuel ﬂow. Placing the mixture control to idle cut-off stops the fuel ﬂow
altogether and stops the engine. In the second method, shown in Figure 6.9(b), low
pressure from the inlet manifold is applied to the ﬂoat chamber by a valve (9) to oppose
the venturi suction and reduce the fuel ﬂow. Idle cut-off is achieved by allowing full
manifold pressure into the ﬂoat chamber. There is no resultant pressure across the fuel
and ﬂow ceases.
The carburettor is a simple device but it does suffer from one major problem. The
evaporation of fuel requires heat, and in the absence of any other source the heat is taken
from the incoming air and the body of the carburettor. In humid conditions this can
lead to the formation of ice in the carburettor venturi. The rapid ﬂow around the edge of
a nearly closed throttle and subsequent expansion into the low pressure in the manifold
duplicates the mechanism of the domestic refrigerator and can cause throttle icing. This
is particularly dangerous because at low power on a descent the ice build-up will not
be noticed. When full power is required to arrest the descent it will not be available.
The engine will artiﬁcially be throttled by ice and the mixture will be unpredictable.
The traditional approach to icing is to supply hot air to the carburettor intake. This
is conveniently obtained by drawing air over the exhaust system. Unfortunately hot air
is less dense and reduces engine power so it cannot be used all the time. The pilot is
therefore provided with a control to select the carburettor heat. If there is the slightest
suspicion of icing, full heat should be applied. If engine smoothness and power improve,
there was icing. It may be necessary to apply heat periodically or continuously to control
icing. If power reduces, there was no ice and the engine is running on air that is too hot.
Heat control requires a disciplined approach because the effects of an incorrect decision may not be evident until it is too late. Heat should be used for descents, but the
prolonged use of heat on the ground is to be avoided if the hot air is not ﬁltered. Some
machines, such as the Robinson R-22, have a carburettor temperature gauge which
is useful for deciding if heat is necessary. Air temperature has less effect on the probability of icing than does humidity. Carburettor heat has another problem which is
that it affects interpretation of the manifold pressure gauge. This will be considered in
section 6.14.
In comparison with modern automotive practice, in which electronic fuel injection
is used almost exclusively, the aviation carburettor is a museum piece.

6.11 Fuel injection
In a fuel injected engine there is no carburettor. The fuel is sprayed into the inlet
manifold just before the inlet valve by a fuel nozzle. There is one nozzle per cylinder.
The use of fuel injection has a number of advantages. Fuel vaporizing takes place in

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 210 — #20

Engines and transmissions 211

a hot part of the engine where icing cannot occur. A fuel injected helicopter needs
no hot air system and full power is always available with a corresponding increase in
safety. Throttle response is instant. The ﬂow measuring venturi restricts airﬂow much
less than a carburettor, and maximum power is increased.
There are two types of fuel injection system. In mechanical systems, the fuel delivery
is continuous and is determined by the fuel pressure in the fuel manifold (also known
as the fuel distributor or ﬂow divider). Fuel manifold pressure is displayed on a gauge
in the cockpit, often combined with the inlet manifold pressure gauge. In electronic
systems, the fuel delivery is controlled by a solenoid valve, one incorporated in each
nozzle. In this case the fuel pressure is held constant relative to manifold pressure and
the amount of fuel delivered is determined by the period of the pulses that operate the
solenoids.
The engine power is controlled as usual by a throttle disc in the inlet duct. In a
mechanical system, a small venturi is created in the duct and the suction created is a
function of inlet airﬂow. The fuel pressure is made proportional to the venturi suction
in the fuel control unit shown in Figure 6.10(a). The pilot’s mixture control changes
the balance in the fuel control unit and the idle cut-off function stops all fuel ﬂow.
The only real drawback of mechanical fuel injected engines is that hot starting can
be difﬁcult because residual engine heat vaporizes the fuel in the pipes leading to the
nozzles. The solution is to purge the pipes and cool them with fresh fuel by running the
boost pump for a few seconds with the throttle ‘cracked’ (partially open). The surplus
fuel will ﬂow into the inlet manifold and must be purged by operating the starter with
the ignition off and the throttle wide. The throttle is then returned to idle, ignition is
switched on and the starter operated again. Once the engine is running the boost pump
is switched on again as a ﬂight backup for the mechanical pump.
In electronic systems, a signal processor computes the correct amount of fuel to
inject. It does this based on the mass ﬂow of air into the engine. Figure 6.10(b) shows
that engine RPM is measured by sensing ignition pulses or with a sensor adjacent to
a toothed wheel. In the inlet tract, the air mass ﬂow may be measured by a hot-wire
sensor. Alternatively the manifold pressure may be measured. The air temperature is
also measured to compensate the computation. As a result the mixture is always correct
and no human intervention is required. In automotive applications, there is only one
processor. This represents a single point of failure not acceptable in aviation. However,
it is quite possible to provide one processor per cylinder each having its own sensors.
It is also necessary to provide electrical power to the fuel injection system even if the
main electrical power system fails. This is easily done using power-generation windings
in the magnetos as is the practice in motorcycles.
Whilst the ﬁne nozzles of injection systems are more prone to blockage than a
carburettor, with proper ﬁlter and fuel management this is not an issue.

6.12 The turbocharger
The power a piston engine can develop is a function of the charge burned on each
power stroke. Clearly a greater charge can be obtained by using a larger engine, but
this will be heavier, negating some of the increase in power. A more efﬁcient way of
increasing the power is to get more charge into a given engine.
In a naturally aspirated engine, when the piston goes down on the intake stroke,
charge is pushed into the cylinder by atmospheric pressure. The elements of the induction system such as the air cleaner, the venturi and the valve stems all impede the ﬂow.

Engines and transmissions 213

Fig. 6.11 The turbocharger uses energy from the exhaust gases to increase the mass ﬂow of the induction
process. See text for details.

As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure reduces, so there is less to push the charge
into the cylinder. The air density falls, so the mass of the charge is even further reduced.
Without some help, the piston engine simply cannot breathe at altitude. Any device
which forces more charge into the cylinder is a supercharger. These were originally
mechanical pumps driven by the engine crankshaft. Later it was realized that the residual energy in the exhaust could be harnessed to drive the pump. This is the principle
of the turbocharger shown in Figure 6.11.
Exhaust gases 1 pass through a turbine 2 before passing to the atmosphere. The presence of the turbine extracts energy from the exhaust gases, lowering the temperature
and the pressure. The pressure drop needed to make the turbine work means that the
pressure in the exhaust manifold, known as back-pressure, is higher than normal. Heat
insulation 3 is usually needed around the exhaust turbine. The exhaust turbine drives
a centrifugal compressor 4 that takes in air through the air cleaner 10 and forces it into
the induction system. The boosted induction pressure is displayed on the boost gauge 7
and increases the charge entering the cylinder. Back-pressure in the exhaust prevents
the charge blowing straight through during valve overlap.
The turbocharger is a simple device, but it may turn at over 20 000 RPM. The stresses
due to this rotational speed are enormous, yet the material of the exhaust turbine also
has to withstand the elevated exhaust temperature due to raising the power output.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 213 — #23

214 The Art of the Helicopter
Turbochargers only became economic when suitable materials were found which could
withstand this kind of treatment for a reasonable lifespan.
A turbocharged engine without some form of control system could be dangerous.
The more power the engine develops, the more turbocharging can be achieved, which
develops even more power and so on. In practice this is prevented by a system controlling the induction pressure. The exhaust turbine may be bypassed by a valve known as a
wastegate 6. If the induction pressure exceeds the design limits, the wastegate actuator 5
begins to operate to cut the power received by the exhaust turbine. At sea level the air
is sufﬁciently dense that only a little exhaust energy is needed for charging and the
wastegate will open relatively wide. As the machine climbs, air pressure and density
fall, and the induction pressure tends to fall with it. The control system senses the fall
in pressure and starts to close the wastegate. This diverts more of the exhaust through
the turbine and drives the compressor faster until the pressure is brought back to the
sea-level value. Clearly engine power is maintained with increasing altitude until the
wastegate is completely closed, and after that, power will naturally fall off.
The compression process in the induction system raises the air temperature and
reduces its density. A further power increase can be obtained by cooling the induction
air between the turbocharger and the engine. This is done by an intercooler 9 that is
a form of heat exchanger. These are uncommon on helicopters because of the extra
complexity, but provided the weight is moderate the effects are beneﬁcial.
It is sometimes claimed that turbocharged helicopter engines are less reliable because
the turbo stresses the engine. Whilst this is true of racing car engines, where brute power
for one race is the goal, the helicopter engine does not use the turbo so much to increase
power as to maintain the same power under all conditions. This can only be a good
thing.
From the pilot’s point of view the turbocharger does not cause any difﬁculty. In
the cockpit the only change is that the ﬁgures on the manifold pressure gauge can go
above sea-level pressure. There may be a boost pressure limit denoted by a red line. An
overboost warning light is sometimes found. Turbocharged machines display transient
droop. When more manifold pressure is called for, the wastegate has to close down
to increase the turbo power, and it takes a ﬁnite time for the turbocharger RPM to
increase.
Part of the pre-ﬂight check is to inspect the turbocharger for mounting security (when
it is cold!). The rotor bearing 11 needs a supply of oil from the engine oil system 12,
and the small pipes should be checked for cracks or leaking unions.
Power loss due to high altitude or air temperature has less effect on a turbocharged
machine and when in-ﬂight power checks are performed it will be seen that there is
more reserve power than in a naturally aspirated machine.

6.13 Gasoline engine instruments
In air-cooled gasoline engines, the cylinder head temperature (CHT) gauge is used
after starting to determine if the engine is warm enough to run properly with the rotors
engaged. After ﬂight it is used to check that the engine has cooled down sufﬁciently to
prevent heat soak when it is switched off. In ﬂight CHT rises with the power the engine
is asked to develop and if it reaches the red line on the gauge the power should be
reduced. If the CHT reaches an unreasonable value for the applied load the possibility
of an excessively weak mixture or a blockage or other defect in the cooling should be
considered.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 214 — #24

Engines and transmissions 215

In water-cooled engines there will be a water temperature gauge which indicates the
temperature of the water leaving the engine. Temperature should climb steadily after
starting and level off at the designed temperature. This will often be above 100◦ C since
the coolant is not actually water but a mixture of ethylene glycol and the system is also
pressurized so that the boiling point is raised.
On turbocharged machines an exhaust gas temperature (EGT) gauge (8 in
Figure 6.11) may be found. This will also rise with engine power and the gauge may be
red-lined to protect the exhaust valves and the turbocharger.
The oil pressure gauge indicates the performance of the oil pump. If the pump can
meet the ﬂow demanded by the engine, the pressure will be normal. If it cannot, the
pressure will fall. Low pressure could be due to a worn pump or bearings, but it could
also be due to the oil being extremely hot so that it is thinner and runs through the
engine faster than the pump can deliver it. The oil pressure and temperature gauges
should be read together to form a meaningful picture.
The manifold pressure gauge and the fuel pressure gauge in a fuel injected gasoline
engine both indicate the proportion of full power being developed and so the reserve
power can be deduced. The fuel pressure indicator is also calibrated in fuel consumption
rate so that the ﬂying time can be calculated from the fuel load.
Manifold pressure or boost gauges are calibrated in absolute pressure, i.e. relative
to a vacuum. In a naturally aspirated engine the manifold pressure cannot go above
atmospheric and it is technically incorrect to refer to it as a boost gauge. In the presence
of a turbocharger the manifold pressure can go above atmospheric and then the term
boost gauge is correct. For a given induction air temperature, the boost pressure is
proportional to the power the engine is developing. However, changing the air temperature changes the air density and so the mass ﬂow, which really controls the power,
will be different for a given boost pressure.
Consequently if carburettor heat is in use, the air entering the engine will be less
dense and so less power will be developed for a given boost reading. If the engine is
derated by setting an induction pressure limit, adhering to that limit with carburettor
heat selected will result in unnecessarily limiting the available power. It is the actual
power developed which determines the stress on the engine, not the induction pressure.
With carburettor heat on, induction pressure can be increased by the correct amount
to restore power without any risk of engine damage. It is important to know how much
the induction pressure rises with carburettor heat for the same power. This can easily
be established by hovering with and without carburettor heat.
With a traditional carburettor heat system, the pilot can be placed in a difﬁcult
situation. In the case of a fully loaded machine on a hot, humid day, full power will be
required to hover. However, the landing approach will require the use of carburettor
heat. At the end of the approach as the machine enters the hover, the textbooks explain
that carburettor heat must be deselected. However, the textbooks do not explain how
this is to be done. At the end of an approach and upon entering the hover, the pilot
must manipulate the collective lever to arrest the descent and use the pedals to prevent
yaw with the increased collective. He must also use the cyclic control to arrest forward
speed. With both hands and both feet occupied, deselecting carburettor heat is difﬁcult.
In the case of the Robinson R-22 there is a simple solution. In this machine the engine
is derated by induction pressure limits to achieve reliability. The degree of derating is
such that, even up to a few thousand feet above sea level, maximum rated power can
be obtained even with full carburettor heat. Consequently under many real conditions
the R-22 can be ﬂown with hot air permanently selected. The boost gauge limit must
be readjusted upwards. This is done by hovering under otherwise identical conditions
with and without hot air to establish the percentage by which the induction pressure

216 The Art of the Helicopter
limit must be increased to keep the power the same. Using this technique carburettor
icing cannot occur, pilot workload is reduced and fuel economy is improved because
feeding the engine with hot air reduces pumping loss. Given that there have been a
number of fatalities in this machine owing to icing it is difﬁcult to see why this solution
has not been proposed earlier. The only circumstances under which hot air would be
deselected would be where ambient air temperature is extremely high or for operation
at high altitude. These conditions can easily be deduced from the ﬂight manual.

6.14 The aeroDiesel
The Diesel engine is a type of piston engine in which the induction process admits air
only. There is no throttle and the maximum amount of air is admitted at all times. As
only air is being compressed, a phenomenal compression ratio can be used without
danger of detonation on the compression stroke. The high compression ratio which
is maintained at all power levels, is responsible for the high efﬁciency of the Diesel
engine. In the gasoline engine, when the throttle is partially closed, low manifold
pressure opposes the motion of the piston on the induction stroke. The compression
pressure falls, effectively reducing the compression ratio.
The compression raises the air temperature to such an extent that if fuel is forced
into the cylinder it will burn immediately. The amount of power is controlled only by
the amount of fuel injected. As combustion takes place with excess air, all of the fuel is
burned, further raising efﬁciency. No ignition system is needed at all. Instead a device
called an injection pump is required. This device produces the right amount of fuel at
sufﬁcient pressure to overcome the compression pressure and at the correct time. Fuel
is fed into the cylinder by an injector. This is effectively a non-return valve that opposes
the compression pressure in the cylinder. When the pressure from the injection pump
has risen high enough, the injector admits the fuel in a conical spray pattern.
Diesel fuel is less volatile than gasoline and represents a reduced ﬁre hazard. On
injection, the fuel begins to burn instantly and this results in a rapid pressure rise.
The Diesel engine needs to be robustly constructed to withstand the forces generated
by the high compression ratio and the sudden pressure step. However, the Diesel has
the advantage that the materials are not subject to such high temperatures. As it is
thermally efﬁcient, less heat is created in the engine and the exhaust is cooler, reducing
stress on the exhaust valves. Water cooling is particularly advantageous with Diesels
because the water jacket reduces noise and the reduced heat output allows the cooling
system to be light.
As the Diesel engine induces only air and has no throttle, the danger of intake icing is
insigniﬁcant and cold air will be supplied at all times for maximum power. The excess
induction air may be used to sweep all combustion products out of the cylinder ready
for the next cycle. This is called scavenging and in a four-stroke Diesel it is done by valve
overlap. Some of the induction air follows the exhaust gases out of the cylinder. The
exhaust valve is also cooled due to scavenging. This is especially easy in a turbocharged
Diesel where turbo pressure assists the scavenge ﬂow. Clearly scavenging cannot be
used in the gasoline engine as it would result in unburned mixture entering the exhaust
system.
The turbocharger works well in gasoline engines, but the extent to which power can
be boosted is limited by the additional heat stress on the engine parts. As the Diesel
produces less heat stress the degree to which it can be boosted by a turbocharger is
higher. As the compressor in the turbocharger will increase the temperature of the
induction air, a further increase in power can be obtained using an intercooler, which

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 216 — #26

Engines and transmissions 217

is a heat exchanger designed to cool the air between the compressor outlet and the
induction manifold. An alternative on water-cooled Diesel engines is a charge cooler
which uses the circulating coolant to cool the air from the compressor.
The boost gauge reading is not proportional to power or engine stress in a Diesel
engine since there is no throttle. If a turbocharger is ﬁtted, the boost gauge will indicate
that the correct turbo outlet pressure exists. A malfunctioning wastegate could cause
excessive boost and an abnormally high gauge reading. In this case it would be necessary
to ﬂy at a lower power level to prevent engine damage.
In order to display the power level in a Diesel engine it is necessary to measure fuel
ﬂow. However, a torque meter could also be used as in turbine practice.

6.15 The uniﬂow Diesel
The two-stroke engine has some advantages for aviation, not least the saving in weight
and complexity due to the elimination of some moving parts. Although power is produced on every piston downstroke, less of the stroke is used and so the increase in power
is not as great as is commonly thought. However, the doubling in ﬁring frequency for
a given RPM allows vibration to be halved. This may result in transmission weight
saving.
At the end of the power stroke, the exhaust gases have to be replaced by fresh charge
at one and the same time. Thus effective scavenging is inherent in two-stroke engines.
Some incoming charge goes out of the exhaust no matter what. The gasoline engine
mixes fuel and air externally and so the scavenging process passes unburned fuel into the
exhaust, doing no good to the fuel economy or the environment. A further problem with
the gasoline two-stroke is that most designs use the crankcase as part of the induction
system. When the piston comes down, the charge in the crankcase is compressed and
the pressure is used to drive it into the cylinder. The presence of charge in the crankcase
means that lubricating oil will be mixed with the charge, resulting in a smoky exhaust.
The conventional gasoline two-stroke engine will eventually be outlawed because of
these environmental concerns.
The two-stroke Diesel engine can overcome these problems because it admits air not
charge. One approach is the uniﬂow two-stroke Diesel shown in Figure 6.12. This is
mechanically somewhere between a four stroke and a two stroke as it still has a camshaft
and valves. However, all of the valves are exhaust valves and a huge valve area can be
used for efﬁcient breathing.
Towards the end of the power stroke the camshaft opens the exhaust valves. Exhaust
gases exit the cylinder and their momentum causes the cylinder pressure to fall. Shortly
after, the piston uncovers ports near the base of the cylinder to admit induction air.
Effectively the cylinder is open at both ends so that induction air can sweep up the
cylinder until some of it leaves via the exhaust valves in the scavenge process. Next the
exhaust valves close but the momentum of the induction air continues to drive it into
the cylinder. This continues until the returning piston closes the induction ports. The
cylinder is now sealed and the air is compressed. Near TDC, the fuel is injected and
the power stroke begins. In an automotive engine there is one injection pump feeding
all of the cylinders. However, in aviation applications there will be one per cylinder so
that a failure will cause a power loss rather than a stoppage. The injector can run from
the camshaft.
The uniﬂow two-stroke Diesel has a number of advantages. The crankcase is not
involved in the induction process and remains at atmospheric pressure just as it does
in a four-stroke engine. Conventional recirculating oil lubrication can be used, without

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 217 — #27

218 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.12 In the uniﬂow two-stroke Diesel engine, induction is by ports in the cylinder wall, whereas exhaust
is via valves in the head. The short scavenging path and potentially large cross-sectional area of the intake and
exhaust ports allow high mass ﬂow.

fear of mixing the oil with the charge. Thus the uniﬂow is a two-stroke technology that
can meet environmental regulations.
The uniﬂow system is more effective at replacing exhaust with charge than either the
conventional two stroke or the four stroke. In the conventional two stroke the fresh
charge is admitted at the bottom of the cylinder and then has to proceed to the top and
turn around to reach the exhaust port. This is called loop scavenging. The four-stroke
engine needs two complete strokes to do this. Figure 6.12 shows that the breathing
efﬁciency of the uniﬂow is high because much of the cylinder head can be occupied
by exhaust valves and the intake port can run round the perimeter of the piston save
for a few rails to stop the rings popping out. As a result the uniﬂow Diesel can deliver
power over a higher proportion of the cycle than can four-stroke or loop scavenged
two-stroke engines.
When a turbocharger is ﬁtted, the efﬁcient gas ﬂow means that the valves can be
arranged to open for a smaller angle, lengthening the effective stroke. When this
approach is used, the engine produces its power in the form of more torque at a lower
RPM. In the helicopter this is useful as the amount of gearing to the rotor may be
reduced.
The uniﬂow engine is not self-starting and it needs some externally produced induction ﬂow during cranking. The turbocharger may be ﬁtted with an electric motor
powered during starting.
In the two-stroke uniﬂow Diesel engine developed by Teledyne Continental Motors,
some additional engineering features are incorporated. As the force on the piston is
always downwards, a slipper big end can be used. Figure 6.13 shows that the big
end bearing does not encircle the crankshaft. This means that both cylinders in a
horizontally opposed engine can share the same crankpin and be exactly in line. The
thrust of a piston on a power stroke drives straight through the crankpin to push
the opposite piston up on the compression stroke. In a four-cylinder engine the two
crank pins are at 90◦ to give four evenly spaced power strokes per revolution. This
conﬁguration requires balance weights on each end of the crankshaft to make the mass
centroid of the moving parts align with the shaft axis. The result is very low vibration.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 218 — #28

Engines and transmissions 219

Fig. 6.13 The slipper big end of the Continental aeroDiesel allows both connecting rods to share the same
crank pin.

6.16 Cooling systems
Most aviation piston engines are air cooled because in a ﬁxed-wing aircraft a supply
of cooling air is easy to come by. This argument is not so powerful in a helicopter in
which the relative merits of air and water cooling need to be carefully examined.
Air-cooled engines reach higher peak temperatures and need looser tolerances to
prevent seizing. Actually the air-cooled engine obtains a signiﬁcant amount of cooling
from the oil. The oil-cooling system will be heavier in consequence. The cylinders need
to be further apart to allow space for the cooling ﬁns needed to increase the surface
area of the cylinder and head. This lengthens the engine and makes it heavier.
The in-line conﬁguration is not good for air cooling because the cylinders at the back
run hotter and the crankcase is very long. The radial engine is the ultimate air-cooled
conﬁguration because all of the cylinders receive equal cooling and the crankcase is
short and compact. However, the frontal area and drag are signiﬁcant. In high performance piston-engine aircraft, such as the Spitﬁre, the frontal area of the engine had
to be reduced as much as possible. This was done using in-line or vee construction
that dictated water cooling. In the Spitﬁre the drag of the radiator and the vee engine
together is less than if air cooling was used.
Water has a much higher speciﬁc heat than air and so a smaller mass of water can
carry away the heat. This means that the cylinders can be closer together because no
ﬁns are required. This makes the crankcase shorter and the crankshaft can be lighter.
When designed from the outset to be water cooled, an engine with radiator need be no
heavier than an air-cooled engine and it will be quieter.
In the helicopter there will be no slipstream in the hover and a cooling fan will
be needed whatever the cooling technique. The power loss of an engine-driven fan is
considerable, as is the noise it creates and any viable alternative deserves study.

6.17 The fuel system
The fuel system of a light helicopter is reasonably simple and the installation used in
an Enstrom F28 is shown in Figure 6.14. The object of the fuel system is to ensure
a reliable delivery of uncontaminated fuel at consistent pressure to the carburettor or
fuel injection system.
The fuel system begins with the tanks. These are invariably installed as a pair, one
each side of the mast. The tanks are as close as possible to the CM so that fore-and-aft
trim is unaffected as fuel burns off. The two tanks are cross-connected with fuel and

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 219 — #29

220 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.14 The fuel system of a light piston-engine helicopter. See text for details.

vent pipes so that fuel is used equally from both tanks. This prevents a lateral trim
change. As the fuel level is equal in the two tanks, only one fuel level gauge is needed.
The transmitter in the tank is connected electrically to the gauge on the instrument
panel and so the gauge only works when the master switch is on. It is wise not to place
too much trust in ﬂoat gauges and it is good practice to check the level in the tank
itself. Some machines have sight gauges in the walls of the tank. Otherwise a good
old-fashioned dipstick can be used.
Mandatory placards are placed near the tank ﬁller caps to indicate the type of fuel
to be used. RED for AVGAS, BLACK for AVTUR. It is vital that the correct fuel
is loaded. Whilst a turbine will run on AVGAS, a piston engine will stop if AVTUR
reaches it. Since AVTUR is denser than AVGAS, it will probably ﬁnd its way to the
engine whilst the machine is still on the ground. A mixture of the two fuels has a very
low octane, and the engine could suffer damage from detonation before it stops.
When ﬁlling the tanks some consideration should be given to the fact that fuel will
expand as the temperature increases. If the machine is to be ﬂown immediately, there
is little need for concern, but if the machine is to be left in the sun for any length of
time there must be headspace for the fuel to expand into or it may overﬂow.
The commonest form of fuel contamination is water. Whilst in storage, as a tank is
emptied, air ﬁlls the space above, bringing moisture with it. Condensation due to low
temperatures results in water in the fuel. Condensation can also occur in the helicopter’s

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 220 — #30

Engines and transmissions 221

own tanks, but this can be minimized by ﬁlling the tanks before leaving the machine
overnight.
Water does not readily mix with fuel and it is denser, so it will be found at the bottom
of tanks. The point where the engine feed is taken from the tank is slightly above the
lowest point of the tank so that fuel is drawn from above any water that may settle
out in the tank. As a result there will always be a quantity of unusable fuel in the
tank, typically about a gallon. The lowest point of the tank is ﬁtted with a drain.
This is a spring-loaded valve which is normally closed but which can be pushed open
momentarily by hand. Part of the pre-ﬂight check procedure is to operate the tank
drains and to catch the ﬂuid that comes out in a transparent container. Any water in
the tank will come out ﬁrst and a clear boundary will be seen in the container between
the water and the fuel once all the water has come out.
The tanks are also ﬁtted with air vent plumbing to allow air to enter as fuel is used.
In the absence of a vent atmospheric pressure would crush the tanks as the fuel was
pumped out. The fuel pickup pipes from the two tanks go to the fuel shut-off valve.
This is in the engine compartment, but operated by a rod passing through the ﬁrewall
to a control often mounted near the pilot’s shoulder. The main fuel line runs down from
the fuel shut-off valve through the electric boost pump to the main ﬁlter; also known
as a strainer. The ﬁlter contains a ﬁne mesh element that prevents debris entering the
carburettor or fuel injection system where it could block the ﬁne jets. Debris is either
trapped in the mesh until it is removed during maintenance, or falls into the bowl.
Any water that gets past the measures designed into the tanks will also collect in the
bowl. The engine feed is from the top of the ﬁlter, so water is left behind. A further
vital pre-ﬂight check is to open the spring-loaded drain valve on the ﬁlter bowl again
catching the results in the glass container. Draining is continued until pure fuel ﬂows.
The bowl is then free of water and can trap the maximum amount.
Fuel from the ﬁlter passes next to the engine-driven pump. This is mechanical and
only works when the engine is running. The combination of electric and mechanical
pump one after the other means that fuel pressure is always available even if one of the
pumps fails. In addition the electric pump can run without the engine, and this can be
useful in fuel-injected machines to purge the injection pipes of fuel vapour prior to a
hot start.
The fuel pump contains a pressure regulating mechanism so that constant fuel pressure is available. A pressure switch operates a ‘pressure OK’ light on the instrument
panel once fuel pressure exceeds a set threshold. Fuel is then delivered to the carburettor
or the fuel injection system.
Figure 6.15 shows the fuel system of the JetRanger. Twin electric boost pumps (1) lift
fuel from the tank and check valves (2) allow one to carry on if the other fails. The main
fuel valve (7) is remote from the cockpit and is motorized. The airframe ﬁlter (8) has
a pressure drop monitor (9) that operates a warning light (10) if blockage occurs. The
engine-driven pump (15) also has a ﬁlter (11) and blockage switch (13). The delivery
pressure is regulated in the fuel control unit by returning surplus fuel to the inlet side
of the gear pump (16).
In larger helicopters the fuel system will inevitably become more complex. In order
to limit the consequences of damage, for structural reasons and to control the CM
position, there may be a large number of smaller tanks, each needing provision for
reﬁlling, supply and a quantity gauge. A full fuel tank is heavy and may break free in a
crash. A deliberately weak point may be introduced in the pipes along with self-sealing
valves so that the tank will not leak if it breaks free. Wiring to pumps and gauges will
also be designed to detach. In military machines, self-sealing tanks may be ﬁtted. These
are essentially double skinned and between the skins is a compound that expands on

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 221 — #31

contact with fuel. If a tank is pierced, leaking fuel contacts the compound and this will
expand, sealing the hole.
Figure 6.16 shows the fuel system of the Chinook. This is complex because there
are six tanks, two main engines, an APU and a fuel-burning cabin heater. In addition
there is provision for pressure refuelling from a central point as well as connections in
the cabin to allow long-range tanks to be carried internally. The fuel is carried in the
prominent side sponsons. These cannot contain a single tank for a number of reasons.
First, a long single tank would be dangerous because when partially ﬁlled all of the
fuel could ﬂow to one end and cause a huge trim shift. Second, a single tank would
be vulnerable to battle damage. Finally, the front undercarriage leg and its supporting
structure occupies some space in the sponson. As a result the Chinook has three tanks
along each side. These are not simply interconnected as if one were to be holed this
would result in loss of all the fuel on one side. Instead the forward and aft tanks each
have a pump which discharges into the main, or centre, tanks. The centre tanks have
two pumps in parallel and valves ensure that one can fail without affecting the other.

Engines and transmissions 223

Fig. 6.16 The complex fuel system of the CH-47. See text.

Each main tank supplies the engine on the same side, but there is also a cross feed line
between the engines so that both can run from one main tank. This line can be closed
by the pilot to prevent fuel loss in case of major damage at one side of the machine.

6.18 The turbine engine
The turbine engine is a more recent development than the piston engine. Although the
idea is older than the piston engine, the ﬁrst aircraft turbines were not perfected until
much later when the necessary materials were available. Whittle in England and von
Ohain in Germany independently developed practical turbine engines during World
War II.
The Otto cycle or four-stroke piston engine draws charge in through a throttle, compresses it, burns it to release power and then exhausts. In the Diesel engine only air is
drawn in and compressed, and the fuel is injected directly into the cylinder. There is no
throttle, and the power is controlled by the amount of fuel injected. Detonation cannot
occur, and low octane fuel can be used. In a piston engine the four phases are conducted
sequentially on a ﬁxed quantity of charge in the same cylinder. The turbine is like a
continuous version of a Diesel engine. Instead of operating on charge one phase at a
time in the same place, charge passes through the machine continuously and the four
phases take place at different points in the machine. Like the Diesel, the turbine can
use low octane fuel and generally runs on AVTUR which is basically kerosene. Also
like the Diesel engine, the power developed by a turbine engine is controlled by the
amount of fuel fed to the burners.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 223 — #33

224 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.17 The turbine engine carries out the processes of the four-stroke engine continuously. Air is drawn
in and compressed, fuel is burned in it and power is extracted before exhausting the gases. The continuous
operation and purely rotating parts result in freedom from vibration. Air is drawn in by compressor blades (a) and
stationary blades (b). Compressed air is delivered to combustion chamber along with fuel (c) which burns at (d).
Hot gases drive the turbine (e) which has stationary blades (f). Turbine (e) drives the compressor by means of
shaft (g). Energy in hot gases exceeds power needed to run the compressor by a considerable amount, and also
turns power turbine (h) to produce shaft power at drive shaft (i). Concept is very simple being little more than a
turbocharged blowlamp. Practical engines require special materials which can withstand enormous rotational
forces and high temperatures.

Figure 6.17 shows that the turbine engine is effectively a turbocharged blowlamp;
in fact simple turbojet engines have been made using turbocharger components. Air
is drawn into the compressor: basically a very powerful fan. This compresses the air
continuously so that a steady pressure is maintained at the compressor outlet. Compressed air passes to the ﬂame cans or burners where fuel is sprayed in and burned
continuously. The charge temperature increases and the gases expand but they cannot
overcome the pressure of the compressor and must ﬂow onwards. The expansion results
in the gases ﬂowing much faster than the ﬂow rate through the compressor. The hot gas
then encounters the power turbine. This converts the energy in the hot gases into shaft
power. Some of this is wasted driving the compressor, but the remainder is available to
drive an external load.
In the free turbine engine there are two power turbines. One drives the compressor
and the other drives the load. Effectively the ﬁrst turbine and compressor together form
a gas generator that powers the free turbine. The gas generator and the free turbine do
not generally turn at the same speed. The free turbine should run at constant speed
because it is geared to the rotor, whereas the gas generator will turn faster if more drive
torque is required. As a result the free turbine engine has two RPMs and these are
called N1 , the gas generator RPM, and N2 , actually the rotor RPM but proportional
to the free turbine RPM. In practice, rotor RPM is controlled by adjustment of N1 in
order to stabilize N2 .
The turbine engine works with steady pressures at each stage and develops continuous
power with only low octane fuel, unlike the gasoline engine which needs high octane
fuel to prevent detonation and which encounters a serious pressure increase during the
power stroke and needs to be strongly constructed to withstand it. The turbine can
be much lighter than the piston engine. In turbines, the equivalent of the compression
ratio is the pressure ratio: the ratio of compressor outlet pressure to inlet pressure.
Figure 6.18 shows a section through an Allison free turbine engine. Air enters through
a multi-stage axial compressor followed by a single-stage centrifugal compressor.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 224 — #34

Engines and transmissions 225

Fig. 6.18 The Allison C-250 light turbine. The compressor has a centrifugal stage and the ﬂow through the
power turbine is reversed to shorten the rotating assembly. Compressor is two stage, ﬁrst stage (a) is axial,
second stage (b) is centrifugal. Compressor air is ducted to the rear of the engine by two pipes (c) and led to
the burner (d) where fuel is injected. Hot gases drive turbine (e) which powers the compressor, and turbine
(f) which is the free power turbine. Power turbine runs on the outside of the mainshaft and transfers power
through geartrain (g) to output shaft. Exhausts (h) are at the centre of the engine and lead upwards. Mainshaft
has its own geartrain (not shown) to power accessories.

The outward ﬂow of compressed air enters two large tubes leading to the burner. The
ﬂow is turned around to lead forward prior to entering the burner where fuel is injected.
The hot gases then lead forward through the gas generator turbine that drives the compressor and then through the free turbine that powers the helicopter. The exhaust gases
are then turned upwards and exit through the top of the engine compartment.
In the centre of the engine are two independent gear trains. One of these transfers
power from the power turbine to the rotors and drives the power turbine governor. The
other transfers power from the gas generator spool to the fuel pump, the oil pump,
the gas producer governor and the hydraulic pump for the powered ﬂying controls.
This gear train also allows the electric starter motor to spin the gas producer spool.
A signiﬁcant advantage of the turbine is that there are no reciprocating parts so that it
can turn a lot faster than a piston engine. More charge can be passed at high speed, and
more power developed. The output torque is unvarying and allows the transmission to
be more lightly built than a piston engine transmission. The power to weight ratio of
a turbine engine is quite incredible. In fact a turbine engine has no natural power limit
because it has no induction throttle and if not externally controlled by restricting fuel
ﬂow could produce so much power that it would reach excessive internal temperatures
or RPM and destroy itself. Practical engines are controlled or governed so that they
can only produce a fraction of this power so that they will have a reasonable life. An
indication of the stress in a turbine engine can be obtained from the turbine outlet
temperature (TOT).
When an engine is controlled in this way the power output is said to be ﬂat rated.
As power is artiﬁcially limited, it can remain constant as the density falls with altitude since this initially limits only the maximum power. Governed power will fall
only when the maximum power of which the engine is safely capable falls below the
governing threshold. The altitude performance of turbine engines is consequently good.
As altitude increases, the reduction in density is beneﬁcially offset by the reduction

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 225 — #35

226 The Art of the Helicopter
in temperature so that mass ﬂow is not reduced as seriously. At high altitude the
governor will attempt to maintain power by increasing fuelling. The reduced mass ﬂow
reduces the dilution of the combustion products by excess air with the result that the
gas temperature entering the power turbine tends to rise. Consequently although the
engine could produce power at very high altitudes, in practice power will have to be
limited to protect the power turbine. It should be appreciated that the power needed
by the airframe may also fall with altitude so this effect is hardly a problem, especially
in helicopters.
Power is controlled through limiting fuel admission to the burners. As kerosene in not
very volatile it is either atomized at the burner nozzle or heated by passing it through
pipes exposed to the burning gases on the way to the burner nozzle. It then vaporizes
on leaving the nozzle and burns readily.
Starting a turbine requires an electric motor which will spin the gas generator spool
fast enough to make the compressor operate. Once a suitable compressor speed is
established (typically 15% of ﬂight idle) the fuel is sprayed through the nozzle and the
igniter is operated. This results in hot gas generation that will increase the turbine
speed until engine power can take over from the starter motor. The starter motor
and igniter are typically turned off at 50% of ﬂight idle. If insufﬁcient compressor
speed is achieved before the ignition attempt, combustion pressure will overcome the
compressor pressure and the turbine equivalent of a backﬁre takes place. In some cases
the starter motor is permanently connected and becomes a generator when the engine
is running.

6.19 Compressors
The job of the compressor is to provide a steady ﬂow of air under pressure to the
burners. Compressor design is fraught with compromise primarily because of the need
to deliver different ﬂow rates depending on the power required. It is relatively easy to
design a compressor that is very efﬁcient under one speciﬁc set of conditions, but it may
become very inefﬁcient under other conditions. In practice it may be better to design
a compressor which is a little less efﬁcient, but which maintains that efﬁciency over a
wide range of ﬂow rates. The compressor can be centrifugal, axial or a combination of
the two.
The centrifugal compressor was used in early helicopter turbine engines as it allows
a shorter assembly and could be designed using experience from turbochargers.
Figure 6.19(a) shows a single-entry centrifugal compressor. The air enters axially near
the eye or centre of the impeller at a speed approaching the speed of sound. The blades
may be twisted at the eye to allow a smoother entry thus avoiding compressibility
effects. As the air moves away from the axis the impeller blades impart higher tangential velocity. In practice the compressor impeller delivers air in a direction having both
radial and tangential components. This high velocity is then converted into pressure
using an assembly known as a diffuser: basically a divergent duct operating according
to Bernouilli’s theorem. The diffuser may at least double the pressure at the impeller
outlet and more in some designs.
It is possible to construct a double-entry centrifugal compressor as shown in
Figure 6.19(b). This allows twice the mass ﬂow with the same diameter, but is less
efﬁcient because the blades run hotter than in the single-entry design which obtains
some cooling at the rear of the impeller. A single centrifugal stage may produce a pressure ratio of up to 4.5 : 1. Stages may be cascaded to produce higher pressure ratios, but
then the advantage of shortness is lost. The centrifugal compressor is relatively easy to

compressors are less efﬁcient than axial compressors and today are only used in APUs.

make, and is less prone to icing, but is less efﬁcient than the axial compressor which
requires more components and may require anti-icing measures. The small area of the
inlet eye of the impeller restricts the mass ﬂow unless the overall diameter is made very
large. Whilst overall engine diameter is less of a problem in helicopters, the weight of
a large centrifugal compressor is unwelcome. Centrifugal compressors are obsolete in
main engines, but may be found in APUs.
In the case of an axial compressor, shown in Figure 6.20, the rotor consists of several
sets of blades or vanes attached at their inner ends to discs set on a common shaft. Fixed
vanes are set between the rotating vanes. The ﬁxed vanes are attached at their outer
ends to a stator assembly that is made in two halves so that it can be assembled around
the rotor. The ﬁxed vanes act as diffusers for each stage of the rotor to prevent excessive
velocity being reached. The ﬁxed vanes also perform a swirl recovery function. It will
readily be seen that the axial design allows a large cross-sectional area to be used at the
inlet. The mass ﬂow must be the same in each stage, so as the pressure builds up at each
stage, the cross-section of the compressor can be reduced. This is done, for example,
by increasing the diameter of the mounting discs and by using shorter blades. In order
to maintain efﬁciency over a range of mass ﬂows, the pitch of the ﬁrst stage of stator
vanes may be adjusted by an actuator.

228 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.21 In the hover, exhaust gases can recirculate back to the air intake and reduce power.

Turbine compressors may be affected by a phenomenon known as surge. This is
an unstable or oscillating condition that replaces the usual steady-state conditions in
the compressor. Surge may be triggered if the airﬂow into the compressor becomes
disturbed. In helicopters the main rotor is very effective at disturbing the air and it is
necessary to take some care over the siting and design of the engine intakes. In ground
effect, airﬂow under the main rotor has some toroidal characteristics, including the
fountain effect, in which pressure below the rotor leaks through the hub and blade
shanks. Figure 6.21 shows that this can draw exhaust gases back into the engine air
intakes. Surge may also be initiated during starting if, for some reason, ignition is
delayed and a substantial quantity of fuel suddenly ignites.
Surge is characterized by periodic stalling of compressor blades. A stalled blade will
reduce the compressor output pressure and combustion pressure may cause reverse
ﬂow into the compressor output. This reduction in mass ﬂow through the compressor then causes the compressor pressure to increase, stemming the reverse ﬂow until
ﬂow breaks down again. The oscillations due to surge are felt as vibration along with
power loss and an increase in TOT as the governor adds fuel in an attempt to maintain
power. Surge may be arrested by opening bleed valves in the wall of the compressor
stator. These vent pressure to atmosphere and allow the mass ﬂow to increase thereby
unstalling the blades.
Compressors work at their highest efﬁciency when the blades are clean. Over time,
the blades get dirty owing to various contaminants, including smog, salt and insects,
and efﬁciency falls. The solution is periodically to wash the compressor. The turbine is
motored with the starter motor and water is sprayed into the air intake. The compressor
pressure-sensing pipe to the governor must be detached or sealed off during washing
to prevent water entering the governor mechanism. The washing procedure may also
require the bleed valves to be wedged open.

6.20 Combustion
The turbine is a continuous ﬂow engine and relies on a delicate equilibrium being
maintained. There are two related problems to be overcome. The ﬁrst is that the velocity
of ﬂame propagation in kerosene is very slow compared to the air velocity from the
compressor, which can be at several hundred feet per second. If directly exposed to
compressor ﬂow, the ﬂame would literally be blown out. The second problem is that

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 228 — #38

Engines and transmissions 229

Fig. 6.22 The combustion chamber diverts a small proportion of the mass ﬂow so that combustion can take
place at low airspeed. The burning gases are then recombined with the main ﬂow.

kerosine will only burn efﬁciently at an air/fuel ratio of about 15:1, when temperatures
of as high as 2000◦ C are reached. In practice a range of fuel ratios between 45:1 and
130:1 will be required, and lower temperatures must be arranged at the power turbine
to avoid blade damage.
Figure 6.22 shows how the combustion chamber is designed to overcome these problems. Only a small part of the compressor delivery enters the area of the burner, and this
restricted ﬂow is slowed down so that combustion can take place. The remainder of the
airﬂow passes around the outside of the burner thereby cooling it. Within the burner,
fuel leaves the nozzle in a conical spray and begins to burn with a roughly optimal
mixture. The burning gases are joined by the annular airﬂow from the compressor and
the result is that the ﬂame turns inwards and produces a toroidal vortex. Burning fuel
can recirculate in the vortex to ensure complete combustion. The high temperatures
reached during this process are insulated from the walls of the ﬂame tube by further
air from the compressor. As combustion is completed, the hot gases are diluted by
further compressor air. As a result the temperature of gases reaching the power turbine
is controlled, and a much weaker overall mixture is achieved.
The burner nozzle does a similar job to the carburettor in a piston engine. In order
to achieve atomization, the burner nozzle contains a small chamber into which fuel is
admitted under pressure by a series of tangential ports. The chamber diameter reduces
to the oriﬁce. As the rotating fuel moves to the oriﬁce, the radius of rotation must reduce
and conservation of momentum suggests that the rate of rotation must increase. As it
emerges from the oriﬁce the fuel is spinning rapidly and is thrown into a cone-shaped
spray. The burner has a similar problem to the carburettor when handling the reduced
fuel ﬂow needed to sustain idle power. Passing a small fuel ﬂow through a burner
intended for full power results in slow rotation, poor atomization and combustion.
Figure 6.23 shows that the solution is to build a slow running jet into the nozzle.
A nozzle of this kind is called a duplex burner and is controlled by a spring-loaded
valve that prevents fuel ﬂowing from the main nozzle until sufﬁcient pressure has been
applied to make it work properly.
Several small annular combustion chambers may be arranged around the engine, each
fed from the compressor. The combustion chamber outputs are then merged together
to drive the power turbine. As an alternative, one large annular combustion chamber
may be used. This has several advantages. Flow from the compressor is annular, as is
the ﬂow into the power turbine so an annular combustion chamber gives better pressure
and ﬂow distribution. The surface area of an annular combustion chamber is also less
than that of a multi-chamber system and this reduces losses.

230 The Art of the Helicopter

allowing fuel only through the idle nozzle. (b) As ﬂow increases the shuttle admits fuel to the larger nozzle also.

6.21 Power turbines
The power turbine is the most highly stressed part of the engine as, like the compressor,
it has to operate at high RPM but with the additional problems of working with high
temperature gases and at higher power. Turbine inlet temperature may be between 700
and 1200◦ C. As the temperature is so high, the speed of sound is correspondingly high
and gas velocities in the turbine may reach 700 metres per second. The power turbines
are almost always axial to provide sufﬁcient ﬂow. Like compressors, power turbines
may have cascaded stages with stator vanes between. The power turbine extracts power
from the gas ﬂow by reducing its velocity, pressure and temperature. As the gases give
up energy, they expand and so the cross-sectional area of the turbine must increase
towards the exhaust. As was seen in Chapter 3, a rotor is at its most efﬁcient with
uniform inﬂow. One of the functions of the stator is to modify the radial distribution
of gas velocity and pressure so that the gas emerging from the adjacent rotor disc has
uniform pressure and velocity from root to tip. The stator vanes also induce swirl in
the direction of rotation. The rotor blades are not shaped like conventional airfoils, but
have much deeper curvature or camber characteristic of reaction wheels.
One of the greatest challenges in power turbine design is to control the temperature
of parts exposed to the hot gas ﬂow. In general oil cooling cannot be applied to the
rotating blades because of sealing difﬁculties and the extremely high oil pressure that
would be built up due to the high rotational speed. Thus in practice the parts must be
air cooled. Air from the compressor can be used for this purpose. Figure 6.24 shows
that the stator vanes are hollow and can be fed with cooling air from both ends. The air
can be arranged to exhaust into the gas ﬂow via small drillings in the face of the vane. In
this way an insulating boundary layer of air is provided which protects the thin trailing
edge of the vane.
The rotor blades are subject to extreme temperatures and extend in length considerably due to expansion. If sufﬁcient tip clearance is provided for expansion, losses due

Engines and transmissions 231

Fig. 6.24 The components of the power turbine are subject to extreme temperatures. The stator vanes are
cooled by passing air along them through internal passages. The air may be exhausted to the surface of the
vane where it creates a cooler air ﬁlm over the trailing edge.

Fig. 6.25 The ﬁr-tree method of blade attachment shares the load over a large surface area which also assists
cooling.

to gas ﬂow around the tip will be excessive. Rotor blades are generally constructed with
an outer ring or shroud to combat tip loss. The blades are cooled by conduction to
the hub and shroud and by radial airﬂow. The hub discs are air cooled to dissipate the
conducted heat from the blades.
The blades are rotating at such speed that the root attachment force is of the order
of 1000 kilograms. Various means for reliable blade attachment have been developed.
Figure 6.25 shows the common method known as a ﬁr-tree attachment. The dimensions

are accurately determined such that when at service speed the strain in the root
distributes the thrust over all of the teeth. At rest the blade will be loose in the hub disc.
The rotational stress and temperature experienced by the blade cannot be sustained indeﬁnitely. Under these conditions, all known materials slowly extend or creep.
Figure 6.26 shows the creep characteristic of a typical blade. The initial extension or
primary creep is rapid, followed by a more stable regime where the secondary creep is
relatively slow. At the end of this stage, tertiary creep sets in, leading to failure. There
are several consequences of this characteristic. The ﬁrst is that all turbine engines have
a ﬁnite service life before the blades need replacing. The second is that considerate
piloting that avoids excessive TOT will improve the reliability of the engine. Finally
in an emergency it is possible to extract substantially more power from a turbine for
a short time than it can reliably sustain. The result will be accelerated creep that will
diminish or even use up the service life of the engine, but the helicopter can still ﬂy to
safety. This topic will be considered further later in this chapter.

6.22 The turbine oil system
The turbine is mechanically straightforward as there are few moving parts. The rotating
parts must be carried on bearings designed to withstand the very high speed. Bearings
adjacent to the power turbines must be protected from the enormous temperature
of the gases ﬂowing past. This is achieved by oil cooling. Heat ﬂows towards the
bearings because of the temperature difference, but the oil carries the heat away at
the rate it arrives and so the temperature can be controlled. As there are no heavy
reciprocating masses, the major function of the oil is cooling and turbine oil is only
about one-tenth the viscosity of piston engine oil so that large volumes can be pumped to
transfer heat. The low viscosity oil is also an advantage when starting in extremely cold
conditions. An oil cooler is used to transfer the heat from the oil to the surrounding air.
In helicopters the oil cooler may be provided with airﬂow from a transmission-driven
fan. The same fan may also cool the transmission oil. Hot oil from the engine may also
be used for anti-icing. In some engines, the oil tank forms part of the air intake.
It is vital that the correct shutdown procedure is followed for a turbine engine. The
engine must run off load for a time after ﬂight in order to cool down before it is stopped.
If this is not done the heat from the power turbines will soak through to the bearings

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 232 — #42

Engines and transmissions 233

and carbonize the oil. Synthetic oils have been developed which resist carbonization
better than conventional oil. Heat soak may be prevented with an electric pump to
keep the oil ﬂowing after shutdown until the hottest engine parts have cooled.
The temperature at the bearings is such that conventional elastomeric oil seals would
have a very short life. Instead oil sealing is performed by the use of threaded sections
on the shafts that have the effect of screwing the oil back to where it should be. The
designer also uses the fact that much of the interior of the engine is at high pressure to
keep the oil in place.

6.23 Turbine fuel control
Turbine engine power is ultimately controlled by the amount of fuel injected. If the
fuel ﬂow is increased gradually, the burner temperature rises and exhaust gases have an
increased velocity. This drives the turbine faster and in turn raises PC , the compressor
pressure. The greater the pressure between compressor delivery and atmospheric, the
more power the turbine can produce.
The air/fuel ratio cannot go outside the limits shown in Figure 6.27 or combustion
could cease. If the mixture is too weak the airﬂow blows the ﬂame away, if it is too
rich the cool fuel quenches the combustion, resulting in a ﬂameout. Neither of these
extremes is desirable, but can be brought about if the fuel ﬂow fails to match the airﬂow.
This can happen if an attempt is made to change the engine power too rapidly. The
accurate fuelling need is provided by a constant-pressure fuel pump feeding a fuel
control unit. The fuel pumps are variable displacement devices. Figure 6.28 shows
that the pump pistons are driven by a swashplate. When the swashplate is square to
the shaft the pistons do not oscillate and there is no ﬂow. As the swashplate is tilted, the
pistons create a ﬂow proportional to the tilt. A spring tries to tilt the swashplate to the
maximum ﬂow position, but the fuel delivery pressure is applied to a piston opposing
the spring. When the fuel ﬂow is low the delivery pressure rises by the small amount
necessary to compress the spring and reduce the pump displacement.
The fuel ﬂow control of a turbine engine has to ensure that the fuel ﬂow is always
within the limits required for combustion. Power is controlled by slightly disturbing
the equilibrium toward one or other of the limits. If it is required to increase power, a
slight increase in fuel ﬂow will begin to accelerate the spool, and as it turns faster the

Fig. 6.27 The range of air-to-fuel ratio that allows combustion is quite small for kerosene or AVTUR.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 233 — #43

234 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.28 A swashplate pump has variable displacement controlled by the angle of the plate. Rotor 1 is turned
by the drive shaft. The rotor contains several pistons 2 which have ball-jointed slippers 3 which slide over the
stationary swashplate. This causes the pistons to move in and out of the rotor. The backplate 5 is ﬁtted with
ports 6 which allow fuel to enter the cylinders when the piston moves to the left and direct fuel to the pump
outlet when the piston moves to the right. The angle of the swashplate determines the stroke of the pistons
and the amount of fuel delivered in one rotation. As delivery pressure builds up the piston 7 overcomes spring
pressure to reduce the swashplate angle and the pump delivery.

fuel ﬂow must increase more rapidly to match the increasing airﬂow. When the desired
power output is reached, the fuel ﬂow is reduced to the new equilibrium level. In order
to reduce power, the fuel ﬂow is slightly reduced, and the spool slows down. As it does
so, the fuel ﬂow rate must reduce to match the airﬂow. When the new power level is
reached, the fuel ﬂow must be raised slightly to arrest the deceleration.
Figure 6.29 shows how the fuel ﬂow is controlled. Compressor outlet pressure, PC , is
delivered to a pair of chambers through small ﬂow restrictor oriﬁces. A large diameter
bellows is ﬁtted between the chambers, and a small diameter bellows is ﬁtted between
the second chamber and atmosphere. The bellows are joined with a rod that opens
the fuel valve as it moves downwards. Air is allowed to spill from the chambers by
two valves controlled by the governors. These spill valves are in series with the ﬂow
restrictors in the compressor line. An increase in PC collapses the bellows and opens
the fuel valve further, admitting more fuel to match the increased airﬂow. A reduction
PC has the opposite effect. The fuel ﬂow is maintained approximately correct by this
mechanism. Power output is increased or reduced by disturbing the equilibrium of the
bellows system using the spill valves.
If the governor wishes to increase power, it closes the spill valves slightly. This restricts
the ﬂow of compressor air and raises the pressure in the bellows chamber, opening
the fuel valve. If this is done too rapidly, the mixture will be too rich and the ﬂame
will be quenched. This is prevented with the accumulator: a tank preventing the air
pressure in the upper bellows chamber changing rapidly. The air has to ﬂow in and
out of the accumulator through small oriﬁces and this takes time. As a result when the
spill valves are ﬁrst closed, pressure in the upper bellows chamber rises slowly, and lags
behind the pressure rise in the lower chamber.
The pressure difference acts on the upper bellows to oppose the rate of increase of
the fuel valve, preventing quenching. As the gas generator accelerates, the accumulator
pressure rises and ceases to oppose the increased fuel delivery. Increased compressor
pressure due to the higher spool power causes the fuel ﬂow to be further increased.
When the governor decides the power has increased enough, it opens the spill valves

Engines and transmissions 235

is used. Pressure in the accumulator can only change slowly.

once more. The pressure in the bellows chamber falls, but rapid closure of the fuel
valve must be prevented or the ﬂame will blow out. This is achieved once again by the
pressure lag due to the accumulator.
In some free turbine engines, transient droop is reduced using compressor bleed. If
the governor develops a large underspeed error it may operate valves to allow some
of the compressor output to leak to atmosphere. This unloads the compressor and
allows the spool to accelerate. This technique is used, for example, in the T-55 engines
of the Chinook.
The rate of acceleration of a turbine engine is relatively slow and this explains the
aircraft carrier pilot’s technique of advancing the throttle to maximum just before
touchdown. If the arrester hook fails to catch, the engine will have spooled up to full
power in time to go around. If this technique is not used the plane may fall off the front
of the ship.

6.24 FADEC
Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) is a system in which the operation
of a turbine engine is completely controlled by a processor. The goal is reduced pilot
workload along with greater reliability. With FADEC the engine starting procedure
is automated and the pilot only has to turn it on. The stabilization of rotor RPM is

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 235 — #45

236 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.30 In a FADEC system all relevant parameters are sensed and converted to binary codes to form inputs
to the processor. The processor then controls the fuelling.

also a FADEC function, along with automatic power balancing in the case of a twin
or multiple engine installation. FADEC systems may also be able to handle engine
failures by automatically increasing the power of the remaining engine.
Figure 6.30 shows that all of the parameters measured by the instruments and the
fuel control, including N1 , N2 , PC and TOT are converted to digital codes and fed to
the processor. This will determine what the fuel ﬂow should be as well as controlling
the starter motor, fuel valves and igniters. Needless to say the power supply to the
processor becomes critical. The power controller will be wired to multiple sources so
that it can run from any one.
Additional feedforward signals may come, for example, from a sensor on the collective lever used by the computer to anticipate a power demand to reduce transient
droop. In a conventional governor if the rotor speed goes above normal the engine
power will be reduced to contain it. If autorotation is entered, the engine power may
be reduced to nearly zero and this will mean that the gas generator spool will be running very slowly. The turbine engine takes considerable time to return to full power
from this condition. At the end of the autorotation a conventional governor would not
respond until the RRPM had fallen below normal and the result would be droop until
the turbine responded. However, in a FADEC machine the computer could anticipate
the end of the autorotation by detecting the upward movement of the collective lever
and it could start spooling up the gas generator before the RRPM fell below normal.
This would reduce the amount of droop.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 236 — #46

Engines and transmissions 237

Sensing the collective lever velocity is also useful in the case of a rejected landing. This
is where the machine is landed but the ground is found to be unsuitable. Perhaps the
machine has started to break through a crust of ice on top of snow, or the landing area
turns out to be waterlogged. Ordinarily the reduction of collective at touchdown would
cause a slight overspeed causing the gas generator to spool down. Pulling collective to
reject the landing would cause droop. Sensing the collective velocity would help the
fuel control anticipate the power requirement.
In twin-engine machines, it is necessary to adjust the fuelling in such a way that the
engines share the load. If the FADEC system is sensing TOT and N1 , either of these
can be used to achieve a load share. In practice, engine tolerances will mean that a
balance of TOT may result in a small difference between N1 and vice versa.
Mechanical fuel controls and correlators are complex and expensive and prone to
wear. The substitution of stable digital electronics will result in the elimination of wear
and allows arbitrarily complex transfer functions to be implemented easily. However,
the downside of FADEC is that it requires the control software to be utterly reliable.
The difﬁculty with computers is that the number of states and combinations that can
be achieved is staggering and it is therefore very difﬁcult to prove that the computer
can correctly recover from every possible state. In the development of FADEC systems
there have been some spectacular failures, including an in-ﬂight rotor speed runaway
on a Chinook that required the pilot to climb at record speed to prevent the rotors
being thrown off until the engines could be shut down.
In well-engineered systems a FADEC failure should leave the pilot, or co-pilot, with
some form of manual power control, even if RRPM is not as precise.

6.25 Turbine instruments
As there is no throttle an inlet pressure gauge would be pointless. The actual power
being generated is a fairly stable function of the reading displayed on the fuel ﬂow meter
so this or the torque meter may be used for power checks. An intake air temperature
indicator will be provided so that the pilot will have an indication of the maximum
power available. N2 (power turbine RPM) is proportional to RRPM and needs no
separate indication. However, N1 (gas generator RPM) will have its own tachometer.
The power turbine inlet temperature (PTIT) is measured by thermocouple in the engine
and displayed on the instrument panel and will be red-lined at a safe temperature above
which the turbine blades may be damaged. In some cases the turbine outlet temperature
may be measured instead. This is simply because the temperature is lower at the outlet
and the sensors may be less expensive. In the case of an engine failure, the remaining
engine may run at higher power and this will cause PTIT/PTOT to exceed the red line
and enter the contingency power range. This will result in a caution light illuminating.
Usually a timer also runs to assess the stress caused to the engine. The oil pressure and
temperature are displayed as for the piston engine. Oil quantity may also be displayed.
There may also be chip detectors in the oil system.

6.26 Fuel management
When refuelling, whoever actually undertakes the task, the responsibility is taken by
the commander of the machine. It is essential to specify the quantity and type of fuel
required and to check that this has actually been supplied. AVTUR and AVGAS smell

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 237 — #47

238 The Art of the Helicopter
quite different and the nose will quickly establish that the correct fuel has been loaded.
Gasoline engines will not run on AVTUR, whereas turbine engines will burn almost
anything. For low temperature operation turbines may be run on a mixture of one part
lead-free AVGAS and two parts AVTUR.
In addition to AVTUR and AVGAS there are MOGAS and ordinary car fuel. Car fuel
is made to fairly slack speciﬁcations and no warranty of freedom from contamination
is given with it. The composition of car fuel may vary with the season. In winter it
may have higher volatility than AVGAS and can cause vapour locks in the fuel pipes. It
should never be used for any aviation purpose. MOGAS is made to tighter speciﬁcations
than car fuel and may be suitable for some aircraft piston engines but should not be
used without a speciﬁc check.
When refuelling from drums, it must be borne in mind that the drums could have
been in storage for some time. There will be an expiry date on the label. There could
be rust or other dirt in the fuel along with water. If this is suspected, fuel should be
taken on through a ﬁlter to remove debris, and through a chamois or felt pad to soak
up water. After fuelling, the tank and ﬁlter drains must be checked for water before
ﬂying. In the event of heavy water contamination, the tanks may have to be drained
and reﬁlled.
If it is proposed to load only sufﬁcient fuel to make a given ﬂight, perhaps in order to
increase payload, an allowance must be made for headwinds along with half an hour
for contingencies. The ﬂight time plus allowances must be multiplied by the machine’s
hourly consumption ﬁgure for the planned load. It is important to be quite sure of
the units in use. Unfortunately fuel can be measured in pounds, kilograms, imperial
gallons, US gallons and litres and there have been forced landings where the refueller
assumed a different unit from the captain. In such chaos, the old-fashioned dipstick
makes an excellent safety check. However, tanks are often an irregular shape and the
quantity is not always proportional to the depth of fuel.

6.27 The transmission
In the pure helicopter, the rotor provides all lift and propulsion. The rotor is an actuator
converting shaft power into thrust. The primary functions of the transmission are to
deliver the shaft power and to transmit the thrust to the hull. Secondary functions of the
transmission include driving the tail rotor and vital services such as hydraulic pumps
and generators. There must be an autorotation clutch that allows a failed engine to
stop whilst the rotors carry on turning. In some machines the transmission also drives
cooling fans. There may also be a rotor brake to stop the rotor quickly after landing. In
piston-engine machines a clutch will generally be needed to allow engine starting. Free
turbine engines have no need for such clutches, but in twin-engine machines having no
APU, an extra clutch may be ﬁtted to allow one engine to be run without the rotors
turning.
Figure 6.31 shows the construction of an autorotation clutch. There are two coaxial
races that are cylindrical. The outside member is typically engine driven whereas the
inner is attached to the transmission. Dog bone-shaped wedges known as sprags are
positioned between the inner and outer races. The sprags are located with a pressed
steel cage. The sprags are slightly asymmetrical. As the ﬁgure shows, if a sprag turns
one way, its effective thickness increases, whereas if it turns the other way the thickness
reduces. The sprags are biased in the former direction with light springs. If the outer
race turns one way, the sprags are twisted against the springs and slip so that no drive is
transmitted. If the outer race turns the other way, the sprags are twisted in such a way

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 238 — #48

Engines and transmissions 239

Fig. 6.31 The autorotation clutch or sprag clutch only transmits drive one way. The dog bone-shaped elements

the dog bones turn the other way and slip.

that they expand to ﬁll the space between the races that are thus locked together. The
more torque that is applied the harder the sprags grip. If the engine stops, the inner
member runs on, releasing the wedging force so that it is free to turn. The action of
the autorotation clutch is fully automatic and needs no control. It should, however, be
checked for correct operation before ﬂight. With the rotor at ﬂight RPM, the throttle
is brieﬂy closed to prove that the engine can slow down whilst the rotor runs on.
The main rotor of a light helicopter needs to turn at something like 300 RPM which
is rather slower than the piston engine which runs at more like 3000 RPM, so the
transmission performs a speed reduction. The turbine engine runs much faster than
the piston engine and the reduction ratio to the main rotor shaft will be of the order of
100 : 1. In a large helicopter the disparity between rotor and engine RPM will be higher.
The continuous rotary power generated by the turbine is free of the torque impulses
of the piston engine and the transmission can be lighter. The tail rotor usually has a
similar tip speed to the main rotor and so needs to run at an RPM between those of
the engine and the main rotor. In a light helicopter, the transmission may incorporate

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 239 — #49

240 The Art of the Helicopter
two reduction stages as was shown in Figure 6.1. The ﬁrst will reduce engine RPM
to approximately tail rotor RPM, and the second will reduce the tail rotor RPM to
main rotor RPM. The tail rotor gearbox contains a pair of bevel gears to turn the drive
through a right angle. This has usually a near 1:1 ratio, but some variation is possible.
In development the tail rotor RPM may need to be changed to obtain a different
compromise between noise and available thrust, or if the solidity is changed. This can
be achieved by changing the tail gearbox ratio. In machines with cranked tails a further
gearbox may be needed to turn the drive at the base of the ﬁn.
Although simple at one level, gearboxes incorporate some subtle detailing. Consider
a gearbox with a ratio of 2 : 1. The gears have, for example, 40 and 20 teeth. As these
numbers factorize, each tooth on the small gear only touches two teeth on the large
gear and any irregularities would form a wear pattern. However, if the number of teeth
were to be relatively prime, every tooth would touch every other tooth and this would
result in the irregularities averaging out. This could be achieved by using 20 and 41
teeth. For this reason gearboxes seldom have simple ratios.
If the gear teeth were parallel to the shafts, the gearbox would make a lot of noise and
vibration as the drive jumps from one pair of teeth to the next. In practice the teeth are
twisted so that the point of contact slides along the shaft as the gears rotate. Contact
between the next pair of teeth begins just before the current pair part company and the
result is a more even power transmission and less noise and wear. Helical gears produce
end thrust on the shafts because of the angular contact. The angled contact faces of
the gear teeth also cause the shafts to be forced apart. The gear case, the shafts and
the bearings must be stiff enough to contain the forces generated without distorting.
Distortion will reduce the accuracy of tooth mesh and destroy the uniformity of the
tooth loading. Tapered roller bearings resist combinations of radial and axial forces.
When used in opposed pairs, the outer race of one of the bearings can be adjusted
axially to remove all play in the shaft and apply a slight pre-load to the rollers to stop
them skidding.
Figure 6.32 shows that in most gear systems both gearwheels have convex teeth
making the contact patch between the teeth very small. In conformal gearing, one of
the gearwheels has concave teeth designed to rotate around the convex teeth of the
other gear. This allows a much larger contact area so that a given size of gear can
transmit more torque. The Westland Lynx has conformal gearing.
The epicyclic or planetary reduction gearbox is popular in helicopters because it can
be built with low weight for the torque handled. Figure 6.2(a) showed that there is
a ﬁxed internally toothed gear which is coaxial with the input or sun gear. Between
these gears are three planet gears that are ﬁtted to pins on the output shaft. As the sun
gear rotates, the planets orbit the ring gear and revolve at the same time. The part of
the planet gear in contact with the sun gear is travelling twice as fast as the axis of
the planet gear. As a result the planetary mechanism itself gives a 2:1 speed reduction
which may further be increased by reducing the size of the sun gear. The torque is
shared between the three planets and applied at three different places on the sun gear
and the ring gear. This makes the epicyclic gearbox ideal for the ﬁnal stage of rotor
drive where the torque is greatest. Figure 6.33 shows a Chinook gearbox, in which the
ﬁnal stage epicyclic gear ring can be seen.
The gear teeth slide over each other, and metal-to-metal contact is prevented by
special gear oil known as extreme pressure (EP) oil. The viscosity of the oil means that
it is not squeezed out from between the teeth by the contact pressure. The sliding
then takes place in the shearing of the oil ﬁlm. Shearing viscous oil produces heat and
the gearbox casing may be made with ﬁns to dissipate the heat. In large machines an
oil cooler may be ﬁtted, perhaps with a fan and oil pump. In some machines the oil

Fig. 6.32 At (a) the conventional gear tooth is convex and has a small contact patch. At (b) the conformal
gear has one wheel with concave teeth and one with convex teeth. This increases contact area and reduces the
distortion of the tooth allowing higher loading.

242 The Art of the Helicopter
tank forms part of the engine air intake so that de-icing is available with no additional
power required. The gearbox usually has a temperature probe which drives a gauge in
the cockpit. It is absolutely vital that the main gearbox is ﬁlled with the right kind of
oil. EP oil generally has a sickly smell of almonds.
The gearbox will be ﬁtted with a sight glass so that the oil level can be seen from the
outside. Some machines have a chip detector. This consists of a pair of electric contacts
that are also magnetic. These are situated at the bottom of the gearbox. If a gear loses
part of a tooth, or a bearing starts to break up, the debris will be attracted by the
magnet and will bridge the contacts, turning on a warning light in the cockpit. Some
machines may also be designed so that the transmission can continue to function for a
short period even if all of the oil is lost.
As a helicopter rotor gets larger, it will turn at lower RPM as the tip speed tends to
remain ﬁxed. The larger rotor will need more power but at a lower RPM. Thus the
torque delivered by the gearbox increases disproportionately with size, and may limit
the maximum size of conventional helicopters. The twin-rotor helicopter has an advantage which is that for a given disc area the rotor radii will be smaller and the RRPM
higher. This reduces the torque needed and the numerical gear ratio, both of which
lighten the gearboxes to the extent that the two gearboxes may be lighter than the
single gearbox in a conventional machine of the same weight.
Rotor forces must be carried into the hull by a suitably reliable thrust bearing. In
many helicopters, the main rotor is ﬁtted directly to the transmission output shaft so
that the rotor thrust is carried by the transmission bearings and the gear case. As an
alternative, the rotor is carried on a bearing attached to the hull structure. In this case
the transmission only provides drive torque and the drive shaft is freed from ﬂight
loads. It is advantageous to transfer rotor forces into the hull as directly as possible. An
offset CM causes alternating bending loads in the shaft but constant loads in the hull.
A further advantage of the use of a separate thrust bearing is that the transmission
can be replaced without removing the rotor. Figure 6.34(a) shows the arrangement of

Fig. 6.34 In the AH-64 at (a) the main rotor bearing is attached to the hull and the rotor shaft does not carry
the weight of the machine. In the rear rotor of the Chinook, (b), a thrust bearing at the top of the ﬁn carries
ﬂight loads.

the AH-64 Apache. In the Chinook, shown in Figure 6.34(b), the front rotor thrust is
carried by the transmission, whereas the rear rotor has a thrust bearing at the top of
the ﬁn. The drive shaft is ﬁtted with a splined coupling so that hull ﬂexing does not
stress the transmission.

6.28 Multi-engine transmissions
There are a number of reasons for installing more than one engine in a helicopter. One
obvious result is increased power, but clearly this is only obtained if all the engines are
working. Another reason may be to increase safety. If one engine fails, the other(s) will
continue to provide some power. Another possibility is to improve range or economy
by shutting down one engine in cruise.
In a multi-engine helicopter, each engine will have its own one-way clutch so that the
loss or seizure of one engine does not prevent the transmission turning. In most cases
twin engines are ﬁtted for safety reasons. Single engine helicopters are not permitted
to ﬂy over built-up areas. Ideally in the case of an engine failure the machine would
be able to continue normal ﬂight. However, this would mean that each engine would
have to deliver the same power as a single engine. In the case of turbine engines this
is very inefﬁcient because in normal ﬂight both engines would be delivering only half
their rated power. However, the power needed to drive the compressors would be twice
the case for a single engine and this would impair the fuel consumption.
In practice a helicopter only needs full power for a short time, typically at take-off with
a full fuel load and landing at a hot/high destination. For the rest of the ﬂight less power
would be acceptable after a failure by using lower speeds and reduced rates of climb.
Turbine engines are very reliable and failures are relatively uncommon. Consequently
instead of overengining a helicopter, it is more sensible to design engines that can be
overrated for short periods of time. Thus in addition to the continuous power rating
an engine would have a higher ‘contingency’ rating which it could only tolerate for a
few minutes. There may also be an even higher emergency rating that might only be
sustainable for half a minute. If an engine enters one of these conditions, an indicator
operates which can only be reset on the ground and a timer runs to measure the degree
of overload.
The use of these contingency power ratings in some cases may put the engine under
such stress that it will need immediate overhaul, but the frequency with which this
happens is so low that the saving in fuel when the engines are working normally is of
more consequence.
Figure 6.35 shows how a twin-engine helicopter might take-off from a rooftop helipad
in a built-up area. The take-off is conducted upwards and backwards at ﬁrst so that the
helipad remains in the pilot’s view. If, during this initial climb, an engine fails the pilot
has the option of returning to the pad and the time for which contingency power is
needed would be quite short. The height reached in the initial climb has to be such that
if an engine failed just as the machine moved into forward ﬂight it could use the power
of the remaining engine and the power obtained by losing height to reach minimum
power speed without falling below the height of the pad or nearby buildings.
If another engine of the same type is ﬁtted to a single engine helicopter, the safety
aspect will be improved, but the fuel economy will suffer because the losses of two
compressors are being borne. At a sufﬁcient height, one engine could be shut down so
that the other runs more efﬁciently. In the event that the running engine fails, provided
the second engine can be started promptly, ﬂight could continue to a convenient point.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 243 — #53

244 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.35 Take-off proﬁle from an urban helipad. By taking off upwards and to the rear the pilot can see the
helipad and return to it in the case of an engine failure below decision height.

Clearly before descending below a certain height the second engine would have to be
started. The certiﬁcation process would have to include determination of the critical
height and the demonstration of reliable restarts.
One important point is that the redundancy of twin engines is only achieved if they are
independent in every respect so that no single failure could stop both. Whilst an engine
might fail because of a non-violent problem such as a broken compressor pressuresensing pipe, it should be borne in mind that turbine engines also fail violently through
blade disintegration on occasions. If debris from a failed engine can damage the other
engine then it too might fail. In a civil helicopter it would be adequate to have a barrier
between the engines or engines designed to contain shed blades. In a military machine,
the engines may also expect damage by enemy ﬁre and in this case a signiﬁcant physical
separation is required so that an explosive loss of one engine does not affect the other.
The pod-mounted engines of the Apache and the Chinook are good examples of this
philosophy.
Figure 6.36 shows the transmission of the Westland Sea King. This twin-engine
machine has hydraulically folded blades but no APU. There is one overrun clutch for
each engine, but one engine has an extra clutch allowing it to be started and run with the
blades folded so that accessory power is available. The accessories are driven through
one-way clutches from one engine and from the main transmission. With the ﬁrst engine
running, hydraulic power is available to unfold the blades. The second engine is then
started and used to bring the rotors up to speed. When this has been done, the clutch
of the ﬁrst engine can be engaged so that both engines can drive the transmission.

6.29 Transmission instruments
A light helicopter may have no transmission instruments at all and ensuring the correct
oil level is all that can be done. In most piston-engine machines, the transmission can
withstand more torque than the engine can deliver and so it is difﬁcult to overstress the

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 244 — #54

Engines and transmissions 245

Fig. 6.36 The Sea King has an extra clutch so that one engine can be started without the transmission turning
so that power is available to unfold the blades.

transmission. As helicopters get larger, the transmission becomes more complex and
under more stress and instruments become necessary.
The turbine has vast power reserves and a speed governor. If the pilot applies a large
amount of collective pitch during a high inﬂow condition, the induced drag on the
rotor will be at its greatest. This would tend to slow down the rotor and thus the free
turbine, but the governor responds by increasing fuel ﬂow so in fact the result is an
increase in engine torque not a reduction in RRPM. This is ﬁne for the rotors but it is
less so for the gearbox where a torque overload could distort the casing and misalign
the gears or break through the oil ﬁlm separating the gear teeth. To help prevent this,
turbine helicopters are ﬁtted with torque meters to display the gearbox torque on the
instrument panel. The gauge will be red-lined at the safe limit for the gearbox and
the pilot then should limit the severity of manoeuvres to stay within the torque limit.
Helicopters with hingeless rotors may also be ﬁtted with instruments to display the
bending stress in the mast due to the application of cyclic control.
The heat dissipated in the gearbox will be roughly proportional to the torque and so
a transmission oil temperature gauge would tend to reﬂect the torque meter history.
An excessive transmission oil temperature is the cause for concern because this may
permit metal-to-metal contact with serious consequences. If the high temperature is
due to known heavy use, the machine must be ﬂown at reduced power to contain the
temperature. If the high temperature cannot be accounted for in this way, then there is
a possibility of a problem such as oil loss, a blocked cooler or loss of airﬂow through
the cooler and investigation will be necessary.
Gearboxes are commonly ﬁtted with a chip detector. This is a plug ﬁtted in the oil
sump carrying insulated magnetic electrodes. In the event of any ferrous debris ﬁnding
its way into the oil, the magnetic electrodes will attract it and the debris will bridge the
electrodes, completing a circuit and lighting an indicator.
There are two basic types of torque meter. In the ﬁrst type, engine torque twists a slim
shaft in the drive train, and the amount of twist is measured with a set of strain gauges.
These are ﬁne metal wires embedded in an insulating material. Four such strain gauges

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 245 — #55

246 The Art of the Helicopter
are mounted in a diamond-shaped pattern on the shaft and connected electrically as a
bridge. Power is applied to the ends of the bridge and the outputs are taken from the
centre to a differential ampliﬁer. As the shaft temperature increases, all of the strain
gauges will increase in length but this will have no effect on the differential signal as all
four gauges are equally affected. However, if the shaft is twisted, two of the gauges will
contract and two will extend, producing a differential signal. The power and signals
are communicated using rotary transformers.
In the second, the end thrust on one of a pair of skew gears is measured. One of
the shafts is allowed to move axially. As it does so it reduces the area of a port that
allows oil to escape from a chamber at the end of the shaft. The oil is supplied under
pressure from the engine oil pump, through a restrictor. Engine torque will slide the
shaft into the chamber until the restriction of ﬂow causes the oil pressure to rise and
oppose any further motion. The oil pressure is now proportional to the torque and can
be displayed on a gauge.

6.30 The helicopter rev counter
The rotor RPM must be maintained at the correct setting during all modes of ﬂight
since the response to the controls and the available lift are both affected by it. Low rotor
RPM makes the controls sluggish and reduces tail rotor authority. Vibration control
techniques employing tuning only operate at one RRPM.
The rotor rev counter is one of the most vital instruments in the helicopter. It is generally concentric with the engine rev counter. Each instrument is independent and has
its own scale and needle, but the scales are graduated so that when the engine is driving
the rotors the two needles overlap and move together. In a piston engine machine, the
engine rev counter is crankshaft driven, whereas in a turbine engine the RPM of the
power turbine (N2 ) is measured. The rotor rev counter is driven by the transmission
after the autorotation clutch.
Figure 6.37 shows some typical displays. At (a) both engine and rotors are stopped.
At (b) the clutch is disengaged, and the engine has been started and is warming up. At
(c) the engine is warm and the pilot is starting to engage the clutch. At (d) the clutch
is fully engaged. The needles are said to be married. At (e) the pilot has advanced the
throttle to ﬂight RPM with collective fully down. At (f ) the throttle is closed from
ﬂight RPM and the rotors continue turning whilst the engine slows down. This action
tests the autorotation clutch. At (g) the machine is in normal ﬂight. At (h) the pilot
has let the revs drop and the bleeper has sounded. At (i) the pilot has initiated a
practice autorotation. The engine has dropped to idle, but the rotors maintain ﬂight
RPM. This is called ‘splitting the needles’. At ( j) the machine ﬂares in autorotation.
Rotor revs have gone up to maximum permissible. If the pilot wishes to abort the auto
and resume powered ﬂight, he must not advance the throttle at this stage, because the
high rotor revs will allow the engine to overspeed. The correct procedure is to reduce
the rotor revs ﬁrst, and then to bring the engine revs up slowly so that the needles meet
at ﬂight RPM as shown at (k). At (l) is shown the result of an engine failure. The engine
has stopped and the rotors are slowing down. It is necessary to enter autorotation.
Since the rotors are turning at normal speed, an in-ﬂight restart does not require the
clutch to be disengaged. Not shown is a condition resulting from transmission failure
between the engine and gearbox. The rotor slows down and the engine may overspeed
as the correlator attempts to maintain RRPM. It will be necessary to enter autorotation
and shut off the engine.

6.31 Tip jets
The use of thrust directly applied at the blade tips has an obvious appeal to designers
because the conventional transmission is eliminated along with its weight and torque
reaction. The tips of a helicopter blade move at a high subsonic speed and jet thrust
matches this kind of application well. Despite those advantages, the use of tip jets
remains uncommon because they introduce other problems instead.
Figure 6.38 introduces the various options available for tip jet drive. At (a) is the
tip-mounted rocket in which fuel and oxidant are supplied along the blade. These react
in the rocket motor to produce a vast increase in volume. At (b) is the ramjet and its
cousin the pulse jet which take in air locally so that only fuel needs to be supplied along
the blade. The tip-mounted turbojet is in the same category. At (c) is the pressure jet
system in which compressed air produced in the hull is ejected at the blade tips. This is
known as a cold-cycle system. At (d) in the tip-burning system fuel is piped down the
blade and burned in the compressed air supply to produce greater thrust. At (e) the
exhaust of a turbine engine is piped down the blades. This is a hot-cycle system.
Figure 6.39(a) shows that the ramjet or athodyd (aerothermodynamic duct) is a
simple device in which air entering at the front is compressed by virtue of the forward
motion through the air. This dynamic pressure is enough to overcome the pressure
due to combustion so that exhaust gases are ejected from the rear to produce thrust.

248 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.38 Various options for tip jet propulsion. All of these eliminate torque reaction. At (a) the tip rocket is
fed with fuel and oxidant down the blade. At (b) the ramjet, pulse jet and turbojet all take in air and only need a
fuel supply. At (c) the cold-cycle pressure jet system pipes compressed air to the blade tip. At (d) the tip-burning
system. At (e) the hot-cycle system feeds turbine exhaust down the blade.

The ramjet is not self-starting and in a helicopter application the rotors must be brought
to an appreciable tip speed before the ramjets can be started. This might require an
electric motor or an auxiliary piston engine. The McDonnell Little Henry experimental
helicopter used ramjets, as did Stanley Hiller’s Hornet.
Figure 6.39(b) shows that the pulse jet is an intermittent combustion device. Forward
motion or a supply of compressed air is needed to start. Air enters the combustion
chamber through a ﬂap or reed valve and is mixed with fuel and ignited. The pressure
increase shuts the reed valve which causes the combustion products to be ejected rearwards, producing thrust. However, when the thrust cycle is over, the momentum of the
exhaust gases in the tailpipe causes a pressure drop in the combustion chamber. This
causes the reed valve to open, admitting more air for the next cycle. An engine of this
type was used in the Fieseler Fi-103 ﬂying bomb of World War II; an early cruise missile
aka the V-1.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 248 — #58

Engines and transmissions 249

Fig. 6.39 (a) The ramjet operates using dynamic pressure from travelling through the air at high speed to
achieve compression. It thus has no moving parts. (b) The pulse jet uses a non-return valve at the inlet to contain
combustion pressure.

Hiller buried the mechanism of a pulse jet inside the length of a rotor blade with the
fuel inlet and valves at the hub and an angled nozzle at the tip. This was known as a
powerblade. Hiller also developed valveless pulse jets in which the gases in the engines
resonated like organ pipes. This overcame the tendency of the valves to malfunction
because of the high-g environment. Needless to say pulse jets and sonic engines also
produce phenomenally high sound levels that preclude their use today.
In the pressure jet system the hull contains an air compressor. This may be driven
by piston engine, or it may be the compressor stage of a modiﬁed turbine engine. The
compressed air is fed through a rotating seal into the rotor and ejected rearwards at the
tips. This makes much less noise than tip-burning or tip-mounted motors. The French
SNCASO Djinn used this system and reached production.
An alternative approach to pressure jet drive is to obtain the jet pressure chemically.
Machines have been built which are propelled by the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. If liquid hydrogen peroxide is passed over a catalyst such as calcium
permanganate or potassium chromate, it spontaneously decomposes into steam and
free oxygen. The noise level of a rotor driven in this way is very low, but the running
cost is fantastic and hydrogen peroxide is corrosive and prone to explode if impurities
are present.
The Doblhoff tip-burning helicopter used a piston engine in the hull driving a supercharger to provide compressed air for the tip motors. Rotor power was only used for
hovering. Once forward ﬂight was established, the machine was driven by a conventional propeller and the rotor would windmill like an autogyro. Doblhoff’s machine
mixed the fuel with the air before it entered the blades. Whilst this eliminated the need
for fuel piping in the blades, it meant that each blade was full of potentially explosive
mixture. In the Hughes XH-17 ﬂying crane the safer route was taken and fuel was piped
to the tip burners.
The tip jet helicopter has not achieved wide use for a number of reasons. One of the
most serious of these is noise. The pulse and ramjet are never going to be silenced,
especially as allowable noise levels are falling. Pulse and ramjets are not fuel efﬁcient at

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 249 — #59

250 The Art of the Helicopter
the speeds of helicopter blades, as they cannot reach a high enough compression ratio
with only dynamic pressure at the intake. Their fuel consumption is about ten times that
of conventional engines, which outweighs the fact that they will burn almost anything.
Hiller’s powerblade was an unsolvable compromise because low drag required a slim
blade section too small to contain an efﬁcient engine. The additional constraints of
the hot-cycle approach make blade design harder because the blades have to withstand
high temperatures as well as ﬂight loads. Tip-mounted motors such as pulse and ramjets create enormous drag when the motor stops. This makes the rate of descent in
autorotation rather too fast for comfort and as a result no machine of this type was
ever certiﬁed.
Pressure jet rotors don’t have a serious noise problem and their autorotation performance isn’t impaired. However, the frictional losses of ducting the air to the blade
tip are serious, with the result that the overall gain when compared to a conventional
transmission is small. Finally, although there is no torque reaction, tip jet helicopters
may need a tail rotor in order to meet crosswind hover requirements.
Hiller has correctly pointed out that in order to construct a very large helicopter,
with a rotor diameter measured in hundreds of feet, the transmission weight would
be intolerable with a conventional design. Instead Hiller proposed the installation of
turbojet engines at the blade tips. With large, very slow turning rotors, the g force at
the blade tips would not be serious and a turbojet engine would work well there.

6.32 The electrical system
The electrical system is needed for engine starting, lighting, instrument power and
to operate the avionics. When the engine is running, electrical power comes from the
alternator. When the engine is stopped, the battery will be used. Most light helicopters
use a nominal 12 volt battery which is constructed from six 2 volt lead–acid cells in
series. Some machines have nickel–cadmium batteries and these will use ten 1.2 volt
cells in series. Late Enstroms and JetRangers have 24 volt systems.
A lead–acid battery only has a terminal voltage of 12 volts when it is supplying a
light load. In order to charge the battery, the terminal voltage must be raised to about
14.4 volts. Current will ﬂow into the battery instead of out of it, and it will recharge.
Conveniently the battery voltage rises slightly as recharging is completed, reducing
the charging current automatically. If the applied voltage is maintained constant, the
battery will take current until it is recharged, when the current will fall to a trickle.
A lead–acid battery evolves hydrogen and oxygen when it is recharging, and provision
must be made to vent these gases to avoid explosion risk. In the Enstrom the battery
is beneath the starboard seat in the cockpit. Charging a ﬂat battery in the machine
is forbidden since it could ﬁll the cockpit with an explosive mixture. The level of the
electrolyte must be checked periodically.
A nickel–cadmium battery has different charging characteristics. When it is fully
charged, the voltage does not rise very much, and charging current continues to ﬂow.
This current is converted to heat instead of charge. The battery temperature is sensed
and displayed on the instrument panel. If the battery temperature reaches an excessive
value, the alternator is switched off until some cooling takes place. An advantage of
Ni–Cd batteries is that they do not outgas or need topping up.
The regulator controls the system voltage when the engine is running and the alternator is switched on. This may be a separate unit or integral with the alternator. An
alternator (Figure 6.40) consists of a rotor (3), driven by the engine, which can be
magnetized by direct current ﬂowing through a coil. This ﬁeld current is fed in through

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 250 — #60

Engines and transmissions 251

sliprings (2) and carbon brushes. The rotation of the resultant magnetic ﬁeld causes ﬂux
reversals in the stationary magnetic circuit or stator surrounding the rotor. A winding
(4) on the stator will produce an alternating voltage. This cannot be used directly in
a system using a DC battery, but must be rectiﬁed using diodes (5). Clearly rectiﬁed
alternating current is very irregular, and in practice a more constant current is obtained
by mounting three sets of coils on the stator at 120◦ . This results in a three-phase alternator and if the output is rectiﬁed with six diodes as shown in Figure 6.40 the voltage
is much more constant. The diodes are usually incorporated into the alternator body
so that they may be cooled by fan.
The output voltage is proportional to the ﬁeld current. The voltage regulator (1)
senses the system voltage, and if it is excessive, the ﬁeld current is reduced. If it is too
small, the ﬁeld current is increased. As a result the system voltage will stabilize at a
ﬁxed value even if different loads are switched on and off. A voltage regulator failure
could result in full ﬁeld current being applied. In this case the alternator output current
would be limited by the inductance of the windings. The battery would absorb much
of this current and eventually boil dry. Some machines have an overvoltage sensor to
cut out the alternator if this happens.

252 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 6.41 Electrical system of a light helicopter showing the position of the ammeter and the master switch.

The state of the battery and alternator can be assessed using an Ampere meter, always
abbreviated to ammeter, which is connected as shown in Figure 6.41. When the engine
is stopped, electrical loads are supplied by battery, and current ﬂows out through the
ammeter which will register discharge (−). When the engine is started, the battery will
have been partially discharged by the starter motor, and current will ﬂow back from
the alternator to charge the battery, registering charge (+). As the battery becomes
recharged the magnitude of the charging current will fall and the ammeter will return
to the null position where it will remain. If the ammeter displays a discharge with ﬂight
RPM, the alternator is not supplying enough current, it is switched off or some load
has been applied beyond its capacity. A common explanation is that the belt driving
the alternator has broken or is slipping.
Figure 6.41 also shows that the master switch isolates all electrical devices from the
battery (except the clock). In some cases the total electrical load is too large for a switch
and a relay or contactor is used. This is a small version of the starter motor solenoid
and is controlled by a small current from the switch itself. Generally only one wire feeds
current to each device and current returns through the metal frame of the machine.
If a failure of the insulation occurs somewhere in the electrical wiring, current could
ﬂow direct to the frame with little resistance to stop it. The high fault current could cause
a ﬁre in the wiring. This is prevented by splitting the wiring into sections and protecting
each with a fuse or circuit breaker. In the case of a fault, the section containing the fault
will carry an excessive current that melts the fuse or magnetically trips the breaker. The
current is cut off and the ﬁre is prevented. Equally importantly, the supply is maintained
to all other sections; only devices using current from the affected section will lose power.
A fuse is cheap and effective, but it has to be replaced if it fails. A fuse should only be
replaced with one of the same rating. If a fuse is replaced with one of a higher rating,
the protection it gives is lost and the wiring could burn in the case of a fault. A circuit
breaker pops out when tripped and can be reset by ﬁnger pressure. In addition breakers
can be used as switches by pulling them out. A tripped breaker does not always indicate

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 252 — #62

Engines and transmissions 253

a fault. Some loads, particularly electric motors and electronic equipment, draw a surge
current when ﬁrst switched on which is higher than their running current. If the surge
current is close to the trip current, once in a while the breaker will trip when a particular
load is applied. The breaker can simply be reset, and if all is well it will not trip. If there
is a genuine fault, the breaker will refuse to reset and it should be left tripped and the
cause investigated. If a breaker trips in ﬂight, the appropriate action depends on how
necessary that circuit is. Loss of the engine instrument power calls for a landing at
the next airﬁeld for repairs, whereas loss of the landing light on a summer morning
is less urgent. Nevertheless all electrical problems should be treated with the utmost
suspicion in case the apparent fault is a symptom of something else. The ammeter is a
good friend at times like these. If the ammeter is showing a null reading, a heavy fault
current cannot be ﬂowing and there is unlikely to be a ﬁre risk.
Some machines have provision for a ground power source to be used. This would ease
the load on the battery when starting in extreme cold, for example. It is important that
the ground power unit is compatible. Some aircraft use 24 volt DC electrical systems,
and if a 24 volt ground supply is plugged into a 12 volt machine extensive damage will
result.
In larger machines, AC power systems are used. These will operate at 400 Hz rather
than the 50 or 60 Hz land-based power because the mass of components can be reduced
as the frequency rises. Alternators may be driven from the engines or the transmission.
As the alternator output frequency is proportional to shaft RPM, system frequency
will vary with RRPM. Alternators will usually disconnect themselves if the shaft speed
falls below about 85% of nominal.

6.33 Hydraulic systems
As helicopters become larger, heavier and faster, the forces necessary to control the rotor
head become too great for the pilot to manage reasonably, and some form of power
operation is necessary. If stability augmentation or autopilot functions are required,
powered controls will also be needed so that the control information can ﬂy the machine.
Control forces may come from a variety of sources. The advancing blade may bend
back putting a signiﬁcant area at some distance from the feathering axis. This will
feed feathering loads back into the swashplate. The advancing blade tip can enter the
region of compressibility and this may also result in a pitching load. It was shown in
Chapter 3 that rotor blades tend to return to ﬂat pitch and a signiﬁcant thrust is needed
in the control system to obtain positive collective pitch. The enormous tensile forces
in the blade root require adequately strong feathering hinges. These inevitably must be
stiff to move. In larger helicopters, power operation will be required beyond the ﬂying
controls. Winches, cargo doors and ramps, underslung load release, wheel brakes and
steering may all be powered.
There are two basic types of hydraulic systems: fully powered and power assisted. In
large helicopters the controls are fully powered. The consequences of control loss are
serious and real systems have to be designed so that failure of any one part (and often
more) still leaves at least some measure of control. Many systems have a completely
duplicated hydraulic system powered by two pumps driven independently from the
transmission. Whatever happens to one hydraulic system, the other should remain
functional. In addition hydraulic systems may be interconnected by motor/pump combinations known as power transfer units. In the case of a main pump failure, the power
transfer unit driven by the remaining system can pressurize the failed system.

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 253 — #63

254 The Art of the Helicopter
In smaller helicopters the controls are power assisted and in the event of hydraulic
failure the pilot can still operate the controls, albeit with greater effort. The JetRanger,
for example, uses a single power assisted control system and can be ﬂown without it,
whereas the CH-47 has duplicated fully powered controls. This section ﬁrst considers
hydraulic power principles and uses the machines mentioned as examples of actual
practice.
There are many ways of obtaining power operation, but the high pressure hydraulic
system has the advantage that large forces can be developed in compact actuators. The
linear action of hydraulic rams is easy to integrate into real mechanisms. In hydraulic
systems, losses are dominated by viscosity. The work done by an hydraulic ram is the
product of the pressure, the piston area and the travel, whereas the volume of ﬂuid used
is the product of the area and the travel. As the ﬂow is inversely proportional to the
pressure, it follows that the smallest ﬂow losses will be experienced when the highest
practicable pressure is used. This is limited by the availability of sealing materials.
A pressure of 3000 pounds per square inch is not unusual.
Simple hydraulic pumps can be made with meshing gears, but higher ﬂow hydraulic
pumps use pistons. Figure 6.28 showed a swashplate fuel pump. The same approach
can be used for hydraulic systems. The pistons are ﬁtted with ball-jointed slippers that
contact the angled swashplate. As the pump body turns, the pistons oscillate with
amplitude controlled by the swashplate angle. The swashplate may be tilted with a
pressure-sensitive actuator. As target system pressure is approached, the eccentricity
of the swashplate is reduced. This is more efﬁcient than a ﬁxed delivery pump with a
relief valve used in small systems.
If hydraulic pressure is supplied to a pump of this kind it will act as a motor. The
swashplate can then be ﬁxed. As an alternative, hydraulic motors may have radial pistons acting on an eccentric. Hydraulic motors are used for winches and for engine
starting.
Fully powered systems operate with larger forces and the losses in the system result in
heating of the ﬂuid. Excessive ﬂuid temperature may cause boiling and loss of control in
addition to damaging the seals. The ﬂuid reservoir may have cooling ﬁns. Alternatively
the ﬂuid circuit incorporates an oil cooler which will typically have a fan driven from the
transmission. In most systems, ﬂuid returning to the reservoir passes through a backpressure valve which maintains the return ﬂow at a signiﬁcant pressure. This prevents
cavitation in the pump, reduces the probability of boiling and prevents dissolved air
from causing frothing and airlocks in the system. Any dissolved air will come out of
solution in the low pressure region following the back-pressure valve and can escape
into the reservoir.
Filters are used to remove any foreign bodies from the oil as these could cause seal
damage and premature wear as well as malfunctioning of delicate parts such as valves.
Many systems incorporate an accumulator or hydraulic energy reservoir. An accumulator consists of a reinforced cylinder or sphere in which a ﬂexible membrane separates
the hydraulic oil from pressurized gas which is typically nitrogen. The accumulator
absorbs rapid ﬂuctuations in oil pressure, allows peak ﬂow in excess of the pump
capacity and also provides continued operation for a time after a pump failure. In the
Chinook an hydraulic accumulator is used to start the APU. The starter motor acts as
a pump when the APU is running.
In almost all cases each hydraulic pump will feed a number of actuators. A single
leaking pipe or actuator would allow all of the oil to be lost and cause all of the actuators
to fail. A number of safety measures can be incorporated. First, the oil reservoir is ﬁtted
with a ﬂoat switch to warn the pilot if the oil level is falling. This would happen if a pipe
ﬁtting was ‘weeping’ oil slowly. An oil temperature gauge may also be ﬁtted. Oil loss will

“helic - CHAP06” — 2003/11/22 — page 254 — #64

Engines and transmissions 255

result in the remaining oil circulating more often and this will result in a temperature
rise. If a seal fails inside an actuator there may be no net loss of oil, but there will be a
short circuit from the high pressure feed to the return and this will also result in heating.
Sometimes hydraulic systems fail catastrophically because of a burst hose or battle
damage. The solution here is to install the hydraulic equivalent of fuses. Each actuator
is fed by an independent pipe run from the pump manifold. This manifold is ﬁtted with
ﬂow-sensitive valves. These contain a spring-loaded ball that normally allows ﬂuid
ﬂow. In the case of a burst, the violent ﬂow due to escaping ﬂuid will push the ball
onto its seat causing it to seal off the leaking pipe. The pressure in the leaking pipe will
then be lost and the pressure differential will hold the ball valve shut indeﬁnitely. The
back-pressure valves will prevent oil loss via the return pipes. In this way a burst pipe
or hose only affects one actuator and the others remain operational because total ﬂuid
loss is prevented.
In the same way that electrical faults can be isolated by pulling circuit breakers, in
some cases the pilot can isolate parts of the hydraulic circuit with valves so that faulty
or damaged units are prevented from impairing the remainder of the system. These
valves may be remotely driven by electric actuators, but a manual operating lever will
be provided in case of electrical failure.
Figure 6.42 shows the basic components of a JetRanger hydraulic system having
power-assisted actuators. The machine can be ﬂown manually in the event of hydraulic
failure. The hydraulic ﬂuid is held in a ﬁnned reservoir that acts as a cooler. A sight

glass allows the level to be checked. The reservoir feeds a constant ﬂow pump driven
from the main gearbox so that power is still available during autorotation. The pump
output passes through a ﬁlter to remove contamination and is fed to the manifold. This
unit contains a pressure relief valve to allow ﬂuid back to the reservoir when the pump
delivery exceeds demand. The manifold also acts as a connection point for the ﬂow and
return pipes to the rams. A pressure switch on the manifold operates a warning light
should the pressure fall.
Figure 6.43 shows the hydraulic system of the CH-47. This large transport has tandem
rotors of such size that fully powered controls are mandatory. The machine has twin
engines and an APU (auxiliary power unit) intended for ground operation. There are
three hydraulic systems, No. 1 and No. 2 ﬂight systems and a utility system. All three
systems are permanently pressurized to prevent pump cavitation and a small hand
pump is provided to allow reﬁlling from a central location. No. 1 system is driven by
a pump on the front transmission; No. 2 by a pump on the rear transmission. The
APU has a motor/pump unit and there is a further pump on the aft transmission.
Utility pressure is then available if the rotors are turning or if the APU is running. All
three systems have variable displacement pumps driven by pressure regulators and have
ﬁlters, accumulators and oil coolers. The utility system has more accumulator capacity
because it is used to start the APU using the motor/pump. The APU will recharge the
starting accumulator when it is running, but a hand pump is provided in case pressure
has been lost.
The utility system provides all non-ﬂight critical hydraulic power and drives the
undercarriage steering, swivel centring and locking and the wheel brakes, the winch,
the cargo door and ramp actuators and the cargo hook release as well as driving
hydraulic motors for main engine starting. In addition, power transfer units allow the
utility system to pressurize the ﬂight systems so that these can then be operated without
the main engines running or the rotors turning. A power transfer unit consists of an
hydraulic motor driving an hydraulic pump. This allows the hydraulic ﬂuid circuits to
be kept separate.

Engines and transmissions 257

The pilot can isolate the ramp actuators and the brake/steering circuits in case of
damage or failure so that utility power remains available. The brake system contains a
small accumulator so that limited brake operation is still possible after a utility failure.
The hydraulic display panel shows for each system the level in the reservoir, the oil
pressure and temperature. There are warning lights for each of the four pumps and
warning lights operated by excessive pressure drop across the ﬁlters.

6.34 HUMS
Health and Usage Monitoring Systems are an important development that promises
improved safety and running costs. The use to which helicopters are put varies tremendously. This means that the wear and fatigue suffered are difﬁcult to assess simply
from a ﬂight hour timer. As a result components have to be conservatively lifed so
that no failures occur whatever the circumstances. This means that a machine used in
an undemanding role has to replace parts that are still serviceable at the same rate as
a machine in arduous service that has worn the parts out. The solution is to assess
the actual conditions of service of each machine so that the degree of wear on major
components can be predicted. In this aspect of HUMS, sensors are located at strategic
points and the stresses on the machine are recorded.
The unacceptability of failure leads to the regular replacement of parts. However,
not all parts fail instantly. Many components deteriorate gradually and do not actually
fail. In others failure is preceded by symptoms that are often present for some time
before the failure itself. For example, a failure may result from a crack. Cracks tend
to start slowly and propagate at increasing speed as the remaining material lessens. If
it is possible reliably to detect those symptoms, an early warning of a failure can be
given. For example, gears and bearings make slight characteristic vibrations when they
are working normally, but these will change in the case of a defect. The presence of a
crack will alter the way a device vibrates. By analysing the vibrations from a gearbox,
it is possible to determine if a part is failing and even to suggest which part. Given that
most helicopter ﬂights are quite short, if the vibration analysis is sufﬁciently sensitive
the failure will be anticipated sufﬁciently in advance that the ﬂight can be completed.
A more sophisticated analysis could determine the rate of deterioration and suggest a
precautionary landing.

Control

7.1 Introduction
The physical control requirement in a helicopter is no more than the application of
appropriate cyclic, collective and tail rotor pitch settings. Implicit in this is the need for
some form of rotor speed governing. However, the physical control requirement is only
a small part of the overall process that is inevitably more complex. In order to perform
useful missions in safety, the pitch settings of the rotors must be such that at all times
the machine has, for example, the desired attitude, airspeed, altitude and geographical
location.
In order to control the ﬂight, information must be gathered about the present conditions, and these must be compared with the desired conditions. Any discrepancies must
result in changes to the physical controls that would tend to reduce discrepancies to
zero or at least as near as makes no difference. This is, of course, classical negative feedback as was introduced in Chapter 2. The essential components of this process must
be information gathering, or sensing, information transmission, decision-making, or
information processing, all of which takes place with small amounts of power, followed
by a power ampliﬁcation stage that allows the control information actually to operate
the controls.
Figure 7.1(a) shows the case of a simple light helicopter. It will have instruments
such as airspeed indicator, altimeter and compass whose output is purely visual. The
pilot looks at the instruments and out of the canopy in order to establish the actual
conditions, but has to perform all of the actions necessary to stabilize the machine and
hold it on a desired course. The machine itself may actually be unstable, in that left to
itself it would diverge from its original course, but the combination of the pilot and the
machine can be a stable system. In other words the pilot is working out the difference
between what is wanted and what is actually happening. As a result of a difference
of this kind the pilot then has to operate one or more of the controls in a sense that
reduces the difference. An unskilled pilot may overcontrol so that the machine oscillates
about the desired course, whereas the experienced pilot will have learned the dynamics
of the machine and applies just the right control inputs smoothly to bring the difference
to zero.
In Figure 7.1(a) the pilot is part of a feedback loop and is not only computing the
servo error, but is also mentally modelling the machine’s response to avoid instability.
The pilot may also be providing all of the control power with his own muscles. This
task must be performed for the duration of the ﬂight, as the machine will diverge if
attention lapses for more than a few seconds.

Control 259

Fig. 7.1 (a) A minimal control loop in which the conditions are sensed from simple instruments and the
view from the canopy. (b) Power assistance is provided for the controls, making possible the use of a stability
augmentation device.

Put this way, the pilot’s task sounds onerous, but it need not be so. In a simple
light helicopter in good conditions this process is extremely enjoyable. However, many
helicopters have to operate in poor conditions, and in addition to ﬂying the machine
the pilot may be required to perform other tasks associated with the mission. The goal
of the designer may then be to make ﬂight possible in all weathers, and/or to keep the
pilot’s stress or workload down to an acceptable level for the expected mission.
The pilot’s assessment of the machine’s attitude is assisted by the provision of instruments such as an artiﬁcial horizon and a direction indicator. These will allow the
pilot to maintain the machine’s attitude despite poor visibility and are essential if the
machine is to be ﬂown under instrument ﬂight rules (IFR). The addition of powerassisted controls to Figure 7.1(a) will beneﬁcially reduce the pilot’s physical workload
on long ﬂights. IFR instruments improve the quality of information presented, but
the stability of the machine is still down to the continuous concentration of the pilot.
Flying a simple helicopter on instruments is possible, but difﬁcult. Two pilots might be
required, one to ﬂy, the other to handle navigation and communications.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 259 — #2

260 The Art of the Helicopter
Once powered controls are available, it is then a small step to make them accept signals
from an automatic stabilizing system that can reduce the pilot’s mental workload. The
stabilizing action of the pilot is augmented or even replaced by a signal processor
programmed to respond to disturbances in the way a skilled pilot would. However, the
signal processor has no eyes and needs information about the ﬂight conditions in the
form of input signals. Figure 7.1(b) shows that the aircraft instruments no longer just
have a visual indication, but also output signals representing the current condition. It
will also be seen in Figure 7.1(b) that the outputs of the signal processor can act upon
the powered controls.
In such a machine there are two parallel control paths. Figure 7.2(a) shows that the
control of the machine can be entirely by the pilot, entirely by the signal processor, or by
a combination of both, with the possibility that the amount of contribution from each
control path may also change throughout the ﬂight. This must be the source of further
complexity. It is fundamental to negative feedback that there can be only one overall
feedback loop in a system. Two negative feedback loops around the same process will
ﬁght each other. For example, if the outputs of the pilot’s stick and the processor are
simply added, by ﬁtting what is known as a series actuator in the pushrod, the pilot’s
controls cease to function. Figure 7.2(b) shows why. It is the goal of the processor to
maintain the attitude of the machine. If the pilot applies, say, left cyclic, the machine
will begin to bank left, but the processor will sense this as an error and apply right
bank. The machine will continue to ﬂy straight, with the processor precisely opposing
everything the pilot does. If the pilot releases the stick, the series actuator may succeed
in moving the stick instead of the controls.
In early systems using series actuators, engaging the autopilot must lock the stick in
the neutral position to give the series actuator a mechanical reference against which to
react. The pilot has to disengage the processor if he wants to resume control.
In the parallel actuator system shown in Figure 7.2(c) the actuator moves
the mechanical reference of the stick centring springs. With the signal processor off,
the actuator may perform the trim function. With the signal processor on, the pilot
releases the stick and the actuator moves both stick and controls. This gives visual
conﬁrmation that the system is working, but more importantly the pilot can override
just by moving the stick against the centring springs.
In modern systems there is a more convenient way. Figure 7.2(d) shows that the
processor is permanently on, but the pilot’s stick is connected differently. If the stick
is released, it has no effect and the processor controls the course. However, in order
to override the processor, the pilot simply moves the stick as normal. This generates a
false error that is fed into the processor. For example, if the pilot wishes to bank left,
he moves the cyclic stick left, and this generates a signal that is added to the processor’s
bank angle error to indicate falsely that there is a right bank condition. The processor
acts to cancels that condition by performing a left bank.
Thus it will be seen that the way for the pilot to override a feedback system is not to
attempt to oppose the output, which cannot work, but to modify the reference value
or the parameter the system is trying to hold constant. In this way the system still
stabilizes the override manoeuvre. For example, in the example of the left bank above,
the system now acts to hold the bank angle constant. In the event of gusts disturbing
the bank angle, the system would correct for them. In this way the combination of
control system and real pilot is close to the ideal.
Figure 7.1(b) showed a simple stability augmentation system in which the goal is to
reduce the naturally divergent behaviour of the helicopter as well as external disturbances from gusts using a parallel actuator. The reduced pilot workload may make
single pilot instrument ﬂying possible. Clearly the stability augmentation system must

Fig. 7.2 (a) When attitude conditions from the artiﬁcial horizon can act directly upon the powered controls,
the result is an autopilot. Under different circumstances, the pilot may wish to have complete control or no
control or even a partial control as he wishes. The control system must be able to react to those different
requirements. (b) In a series actuator system, a servo extends or shortens a pushrod from the control column.
If the autopilot is on, it will simply cancel everything the pilot does. If the pilot releases the stick, the actuator

is engaged. (c) A parallel actuator system in which the actuator moves the centre reference of the cyclic stick

pilot must still select the course. With an autopilot coupled to a ﬂight director, navigational inputs can control

understand the dynamic response of the helicopter in order to avoid any overshooting
or oscillation when correcting the attitude. The attitude of the machine is still controlled
by the pilot, but the stability of the machine is improved by using attitude signals from
the artiﬁcial horizon.
In Figure 7.3 the process has been taken one stage further. Here the augmented
stability achieved in Figure 7.1(b) makes it possible for the machine to be controlled
automatically. Inputs to the signal processor from the altimeter, the airspeed indicator
and from a compass allow the machine to hold a heading without any action from the
pilot. This system is generally called an automatic pilot or just an autopilot.
The system of Figure 7.3 relieves the pilot of the need to ﬂy the machine continuously,
but can only hold a heading and would not compensate for a change in wind strength
or direction. However, with further inputs from a navigation system or from a ﬂight
director the machine could hold a course determined by a GPS receiver, VOR beacon
or an instrument landing system (ILS). In this case the ﬂight director creates a further
feedback loop. The actual course is computed by navigational equipment and compared
with the desired course. Any error is then fed to the autopilot as a modiﬁed heading
reference.
In early helicopters, the provision of stability augmentation and autopilot systems
was frequently optional, whereas in modern machines such systems are often designed
in from the outset. One modern trend is away from instruments with a direct visual
readout. Instead instruments may be used which have only an electrical output and are
best called sensors or transducers. These outputs are supplied not only to the autopilot,
but also to a display processor that produces a virtual instrument panel on a computer
graphics-type display. This is known colloquially as ‘glass cockpit’ technology. One
advantage is that the instruments themselves can be located anywhere convenient and
do not have to be in the instrument panel.
In helicopters, the stability augmentation and autopilot capabilities may be extended
into the hover. In this case altitude and airspeed information from atmospheric pressure
is not good enough and instead RADAR will be used to measure height and groundspeed. In ﬂying cranes and in search-and-rescue helicopters the ability to remain at a

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 262 — #5

Control 263

ﬁxed point in the hover despite external disturbances is extremely valuable. In advanced
search-and-rescue helicopters the pilot simply presses a button as he ﬂies directly over
the victim and the helicopter will automatically perform a 360◦ turn and come to the
hover at exactly the same place.
A helicopter with a suitable degree of automation does not need a pilot on board
if the commands he would have given the autopilot can be transmitted by radio. This
makes possible a range of devices from the simple radio-controlled helicopter, which
must remain within the pilot’s view, to the autonomous drone that can undertake an
entire mission without human intervention.
The provision of various control, stabilization or autopilot systems depends upon a
number of fundamental technologies. These include the signalling of control positions
from one place to another, power operation of controls, attitude sensing, altitude and
airspeed sensing, parameter signalling and feedback control. The subject of safety must
also arise. What happens if any of these mechanisms go wrong? These concepts will be
considered in this chapter.

7.2 Flight sensors
There are four main categories of ﬂight instrument into which virtually any device can
be placed. These will be contrasted prior to a detailed discussion of each one.
(a) Heading sensing devices to display information relating to the direction the helicopter is pointing in. The most important of these is the magnetic compass that
displays the magnetic heading or direction with respect to the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.
The direction indicator (DI) is a gyroscopic device arranged to display the same
heading as the compass. It is less affected by manoeuvres than the compass and is
easier to read. The rate of turn indicator, usually just called the turn indicator, is a
gyroscopic device that displays the rate at which the heading is changing and the
direction of the change.
(b) Height sensing indicators display the vertical distance between the helicopter and
some reference. The altimeter is a pressure-sensing device whose display is calibrated in feet or metres. It is important to use the appropriate reference or the
display will be misleading. The RADAR altimeter is an electronic device which
times the reﬂections of radio waves emitted downwards from the helicopter and so
displays the height above ground. The vertical speed indicator measures the rate
of change of air pressure and displays rate of altitude change and direction, usually in hundreds of feet per minute. Height information is also available from GPS
receivers.
(c) The airspeed indicator (ASI) is a device that measures the dynamic pressure of the
air caused by forward motion of the helicopter. The scale is calibrated in knots or
mph. It is also possible to measure ground velocity using Doppler RADAR and
this will allow the helicopter’s track to be established. In this way the heading can
be adjusted to cancel the effects of wind.
(d) Attitude-sensing instruments display the attitude of the helicopter in pitch and roll
with respect to the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. These are commonly gyroscopic and
include the artiﬁcial horizon, which displays pitch and roll on one instrument, and
the simpler rate of turn display.
The above classiﬁcation is of most use to the pilot since in ﬂight one is more concerned
with the readings themselves than how the instruments work internally. As well as

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 263 — #6

264 The Art of the Helicopter
classiﬁcation by the quantity displayed, instruments can also be categorized by the
internal operating principles, and this is more appropriate to a technical description.
The internal operating principle can be magnetic, pressure, gyroscopic, optical or radio
and these principles will be examined in turn.

7.3 The magnetic compass
The simple compass is a small freely suspended magnet that attempts to align itself
with the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 7.4(a) shows that the earth acts as if a large bar
magnet were buried inside it. The north-seeking pole of the compass magnet (generally
just called the north pole) is so called because it points to the north. As opposite poles
attract, clearly the magnetic pole at the north end of the earth is actually a south pole.
It is called the north magnetic pole because of where it is. Figure 7.4 also shows that
as the lines of magnetic force return to the poles, they angle sharply into the ground.
This is called magnetic dip and in the UK lines of force enter the ground at about 65◦
to the horizontal. A simple bar magnet suspended at its CM would adopt that angle of
dip. Only the horizontal component of the earth’s ﬁeld is useful for navigation so dip
is clearly a nuisance. There is no dip at the equator since lines of force are parallel to
the ground there. Near the magnetic poles compasses are useless.
The axis of the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is not aligned with the rotational axis, and so
the magnetic poles are some distance from the true poles. The north magnetic pole
has been wandering about in northern Canada in recent history. Maps are made with
latitude/longitude grids that relate to the true poles, and so a line of longitude by
deﬁnition points true north. As the magnetic pole is not at the true pole, a magnetic
compass does not point to true north. Variation is measured in degrees and direction. For example, if the compass points 8◦ to the west of true north, the variation
is 8◦ W.
In order to use the magnetic heading for navigation, maps are drawn with additional
lines which show the variation. A line joining all points having the same variation is
called an isogonal line. On a map covering a large area, isogonals are drawn every 2◦ .
There is one line joining places of zero variation called the agonal line and which
currently passes through Sweden. On charts covering a small area in great detail
the variation is shown once and can be considered to be the same over the whole
chart.
Direction is expressed in degrees clockwise from North or by the cardinal points
North, South, East and West and can be true (T) or magnetic (M). The degree symbol is often omitted and heading will simply be a three-digit number followed by the
magnetic/true descriptor, e.g. 295M, 310T.
Runways are numbered according to their magnetic direction but rounded to twodigit accuracy. The runway name is painted at the landing end. Thus a runway running
east–west would have 09 painted at the western end since this would be visible to an
aircraft ﬂying on a course of 90◦ . The number 27 would be painted at the opposite end
where it would be seen by an aircraft ﬂying on a course of 270◦ .
A simple bar magnet will also oscillate about true north if disturbed because the
earth’s ﬁeld acts like a weak spring and the magnet has rotational inertia. The balance
wheel of a watch oscillates in the same way. In order to damp oscillations, aircraft compasses incorporate a liquid. Figure 7.4(b) shows the construction of a typical aircraft
compass. The magnet is actually a number of magnets, typically four, embedded in a
disc made of some non-magnetic material such as plastic. The outside of the disc is
engraved with the magnetic heading which will be read off against a mark on the case

called the lubber line. Since the compass is invariably mounted ahead of the pilot, the
lubber line will be at the back of the unit, and so the engraving is rotated 180◦ with
respect to the magnet. Thus if the helicopter and pilot and magnet are all facing due
north, the part of the disc with ‘N’ on it will be facing the pilot.
Compass dip is minimized by pivoting the disc well above the CM. If the dip exerts
a tilting couple, the CM moves from below the pivot to balance it. The disc remains
within 2 or 3◦ of horizontal as the vertical component of the earth’s ﬁeld is thus opposed.
The disc rotates until the magnet is parallel to the horizontal component of the earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld. Oscillation is prevented by the viscosity of the liquid acting on the large
periphery of the disc.
The contact pressure between the pivot and the disc is reduced by buoyancy of the
liquid and this reduces friction. When visualizing how a compass works, it is important
to remember that the compass disc tries to keep pointing the same way as the helicopter
turns around it.

7.4 Compass errors
A magnetic compass is simple and reliable and needs no power, but it has a number of
characteristics that need to be understood if it is to be used correctly. The compass can
only align itself to the ﬁeld it experiences. If something external to the compass disturbs
the direction of that ﬁeld, the compass cannot know and will point to a false north. The
result is known as deviation and should not be confused with variation. This is shown in
Figure 7.4(c). A helicopter contains a wealth of components that are necessarily magnetized such as the magnetos, the alternator, the electric fuel pump, the motors in the
trim system and gyroscopic instruments and the moving coil drive units in the headsets.
Additionally many of the parts of a helicopter whilst not magnetic themselves are
ferrous and can distort the earth’s ﬁeld by their presence. Any steel tubing in the hull, the
engine and gearbox and the crankshaft, con rods and gears are all ferrous. Aluminium,
brass, glass ﬁbre and plastics are non-ferrous and have no effect.
The sum of all of the effects of the helicopter’s structure on the compass determines the
deviation. Before a helicopter can be released to service the deviation must be measured
and displayed on a deviation card (Figure 7.4(d)) mounted next to the compass. The
deviation card is completed at the end of a procedure called swinging the compass.
The helicopter is taken away from buildings and aligned with each cardinal point in
turn. The deviation due to the machine’s own magnetism can be detected by this process
as at some points it will increase the compass reading and at other points it will reduce
it. Sometimes the deviation can be reduced by the installation of ferrous compensators
adjacent to the compass, but in any case the remaining deviation must be measured
every 30◦ and recorded on the deviation card. This should be done with the engine
running as a rotating permanent magnet has less effect than when it is stationary. Since
radios can also generate magnetic ﬁelds, these must be tested for deviation effects.
It was stated above that the dip of the compass is overcome provided the disc stays
horizontal. Unfortunately there are occasions in the normal ﬂight of a helicopter when
this is not the case and the compass dip is not overcome but acts to give an erroneous
reading. The problem is caused whenever the machine accelerates in a horizontal plane.
The acceleration can be due to a speed change or due to ﬂying at steady speed in a turn.
Figure 7.5(a) shows a helicopter which has just taken off and is accelerating forwards.
The rotor thrust is inclined well forward and is accelerating the machine in a horizontal
plane. The helicopter hangs from the rotor head like a pendulum, and the compass
disc CM hangs from the pivot in the same way. As a result the compass disc in a pure
helicopter usually stays very nearly parallel to the cockpit ﬂoor. The effect of the tilted
disc during acceleration depends on the direction of ﬂight and the hemisphere in which
the machine is ﬂying. If the machine in the example were to be heading 000◦ M the
disc tilt will be in the same direction as the dip and there is no effect. However, in
the example here the machine accelerates along 270M and the disc is inclined west
down/east up. The vertical component of the earth’s ﬁeld will rotate the north pole
of the disc downwards and increase the heading shown against the lubber line. In the
southern hemisphere, or if accelerating east, the opposite effect is obtained and the
heading shown will reduce. On the equator the effect is absent.
Acceleration in the horizontal plane will also occur in a banked turn, which is the
only kind of turn a helicopter can make at speed. Figure 7.5(b) shows a helicopter in
a sharp bank to port. As the nose of the machine passes through magnetic north the
acceleration is to the west and the disc tilts west down/east up. The vertical component
of the earth’s ﬁeld once more rotates the disc down at the north pole and increases the
heading displayed.

(b)

Fig. 7.5 (a) When a helicopter accelerates at 270M in the northern hemisphere, dip will pull the north pole
of the compass down and increases the apparent heading. (b) In a sharp bank there will also be acceleration
towards the centre of the turn and a further acceleration error will occur.

Erroneous explanations will be encountered attributing some of the rotation of the
compass disc to the acceleration alone, but a moment’s thought will conﬁrm that a
couple cannot be conveyed through a single pivot. It is almost certain that there will
be a question on compass acceleration errors in one of the pilot’s examinations, and
the correct answer will be obtained following the process below:
(a) Visualize the manoeuvre and the attitude of the rotor disc. The compass disc will
be very nearly parallel to the rotor disc.
(b) If the disc is tilted north down/south up or vice versa there is no effect. If the tilt is
east down/west up or vice versa there will be an error.
(c) Visualize the tilted compass disc in the earth’s dipping magnetic ﬁeld. In the
northern hemisphere the north-seeking pole dips; in the southern hemisphere the
south-seeking pole dips.
(d) The dip will turn the tilted disc. Visualize whether this increases or reduces the
heading read off against the lubber line.
Here is an example: a machine turns to port through north in the southern hemisphere.
The rotor disc and compass disc will be tilted down on the west side, so the dip in
the southern hemisphere will pull the south-seeking pole down. The compass disc is
turned clockwise when seen from above. This causes the heading in degrees to be less
than it should be. The pilot should turn to a greater reading or ‘overshoot the turn’
to compensate. In practice the error is countered by turning to a greater or a lesser
indicated heading that will become the correct heading when the turn ceases and the
compass settles.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 268 — #11

Control 269

In most cases the machine will have a gyroscopic direction indicator (see section 7.12)
set to the same heading as the compass during steady ﬂight. The direction indicator is
used for turns because it does not suffer from acceleration errors so it is only necessary
to invoke the theory if the DI fails.
In everyday use there is very little that can go wrong with a compass. It should be
inspected for leaks of the liquid, for bubbles or for some obvious broken or cracked
component, and if the transparent housing is plastic, this may darken as the material
degrades with age and indicates that it is becoming brittle as well as difﬁcult to see
through. The deviation card must be present and the machine must have been swung
on the appropriate occasions.

7.5 The ﬂux gate compass
Figure 7.6(a) shows how a ﬂux gate compass works. There are three radial pole assemblies and the side view shows that these are split so that a single coil with a vertical axis
can be wound at the centre. There are a further three coils, one on each limb. The pole
pieces are made of a highly permeable material such as permalloy. The entire assembly
is suspended below a Hooke joint so that in steady ﬂight it will hang level. An alternating excitation signal, typically 400 Hz, is applied to the central coil. In the absence of
any external magnetic ﬁeld, there would be no signal induced in the three sense coils
because they are wound around both poles and the ﬂux from the excitation coil would
cancel out. However, in the presence of the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, the highly permeable material is more prone to saturation in one direction than the other. Figure 7.6(b)
shows that the earth’s ﬁeld adds to the excitation and shifts the operating point along
the characteristic curve of the magnetic material. It will be seen in Figure 7.6(b) that
the curvature of the magnetization characteristic has the effect of asymmetrically compressing the ﬂux waveform so that there is a resultant ﬂux in the sensor coil. The relative
amplitudes of the three alternating signals induced in the sensor coils are a function of
the direction of the earth’s ﬁeld.
The three signals are sent to any remote instrument needing magnetic heading information. This could be a simple display or a tied gyroscopic DI. Figure 7.7 shows how
a remote display works. The three signals from the ﬂux gate are supplied to three coils
arranged at 120◦ . There is also a second single coil that can rotate with respect to the
three input coils. The resultant of the ﬂux produced by these three coils will have a
direction determined by the direction of the earth’s ﬁeld at the sensor. As this is an
alternating ﬂux it will induce a voltage in the secondary coil. However, if this coil is
exactly at right angles to the resultant ﬂux, no voltage will be induced.
Figure 7.7 shows that the secondary coil signal is connected to an ampliﬁer that
drives a motor to turn the secondary coil and the display card. The ampliﬁer will drive
the motor until the secondary coil is transverse to the resultant ﬁeld of the three input
coils. At this point the induced signal will disappear and the motor will stop. Thus as
the magnetic heading of the machine changes, the signals from the ﬂux gate change the
resultant ﬂux direction in the display. The secondary coil is driven until it once more is
in a null. In this way the motor and secondary coil follow the angle of the earth’s ﬁeld
with respect to the ﬂux gate.
The ﬂux gate compass has no controls and can be mounted anywhere convenient. In
a ﬁxed-wing aircraft the wing tip is a favoured location as it is well away from heavy
ferrous objects. In a helicopter the tail boom could be used. Some ﬂux gate compasses
contain additional coils fed with carefully calibrated currents from a control box in

limbs of the device differently and its direction can be established from the relationship between the three output
signals.

Fig. 7.7 The remote indicator for a ﬂux gate compass works by aligning its rotatable coil at right angles to the
resultant ﬂux generate by the three signals from the compass. At all other angles a voltage will be induced in
the coil and this will be ampliﬁed to drive the motor. The coil also carries the direction indicator.

order to cancel out deviation. In this case during swinging of the compass the goal is
to ﬁnd the correct values for these currents.
It is also possible to remove the variation in the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and obtain a
true heading rather than a magnetic heading. This requires a device called a differential
transmitter. This contains two sets of windings at 120◦ , but one set can be turned by an
operator control. If the two sets of windings are aligned, the relative amplitudes of the
signals coming out will be the same as those entering, but if the secondary winding is
turned, the output signals are effectively rotated. Thus if the differential transmitter is
set to the amount of local magnetic variation, the remote display will read true heading.

7.6 Pressure instruments
The instruments operated by pressure are the altimeter, the vertical speed indicator
(VSI) and the airspeed indicator (ASI). Of these, the ﬁrst two measure static pressure
piped to the instruments from the static vents, whereas the ASI measures the dynamic
pressure due to motion sensed as the pressure difference between the pitot head and the
static vents. The necessary pipework is shown in Figure 7.8. The static vents are usually
installed one each side of the fuselage in order to cancel any effect due to asymmetrical
airﬂow. Each carries a mandatory placard stating that the vent is to be kept clear. The
static pipes initially run upwards from the vents to prevent the entry of water.
The pitot head is installed facing forward at some point where the airﬂow is reasonably
undisturbed. It may be heated to prevent icing. The pitot should be checked for blockage
as part of the pre-ﬂight checks. It is good practice to cap the pitot with a suitable cover
when the machine is on the ground, in which case the checks will include the removal
and stowage of the cover.

7.7 The altimeter
The altimeter is to all intents and purposes an aneroid barometer. The mechanism is
shown in Figure 7.9. It contains a sealed capsule that is corrugated to allow it to ﬂex.
The capsule is evacuated, hence the term aneroid, and so ambient pressure attempts to
crush it. The stiffness of the corrugations and a separate spring oppose the pressure.
The capsule will expand as ambient pressure falls with rising altitude, and a system of

272 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 7.8 The pipework involved with pressure-sensing instruments. These require a dynamic pressure feed
from a forward facing port or pitot head and a static pressure feed typically from ports on the side of the hull.

Fig. 7.9 The altimeter is essentially a barometer ﬁtted with a control that can adjust the reference. This allows
it to display altitude with respect to a pressure that has been input on the setting scale. Evacuated bellows (a)
is sensing element in conjunction with spring (b). Rising air pressure collapses bellows and stretches spring.
Falling air pressure allows the spring to expand the capsule. Capsule movement is ampliﬁed by lever (c) which
operates the display pointers via a system of gears (d). Altimeter is compensated for ambient pressure by turning
knob (e) according to subscale setting required on the card (f). Subscale knob is arranged to stretch or relax the
spring slightly in order to give zero reading at a range of barometric pressures. The case of the instrument is
connected to the static vent pipe.

links and gears ampliﬁes the small capsule expansion to move the pointer over a scale.
The aneroid altimeter needs no power except to illuminate the scale.
A conventional barometer measures absolute pressure for meteorological purposes,
whereas the altimeter is required to measure the pressure difference between its present
location and some reference pressure in order to compensate for barometric changes.
The pressure difference is, however, displayed in feet (or metres). The reference pressure

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 272 — #15

Control 273

is set by the use of a control knob. Turning the knob will simultaneously change the
reference pressure displayed on the subscale and the aneroid capsule spring tension.
If, for example, the reference pressure is to be raised, the act of setting the higher pressure on the subscale slightly extends the spring and the capsule will reach equilibrium
showing a higher altitude. Conversely if a lower reference pressure is to be used, the
spring is allowed to contract slightly and the capsule reaches equilibrium with a lower
altitude reading. Throughout this process the absolute pressure at the altimeter did not
change, but the pressure difference and the altitude did because the subscale setting
was changed. Clearly without an appropriate subscale setting an altimeter reading is
meaningless. It should also be clear that, in general, height and altitude are different.
There are three main subscale settings used with an altimeter and these are shown
in Figure 7.10(a). If the subscale is set to the ground pressure at the elevation of the
airﬁeld, the altimeter will read zero prior to take-off and in ﬂight will measure height
above the airﬁeld. The barometric pressure at an airﬁeld is called QFE. The ‘Q’ dates
from the days of carrier wave radio and Morse code and indicates a question. An
aircraft arriving at an airﬁeld may ask for QFE in order to set the altimeter subscale
so that the altimeter reads height above the ﬁeld. QFE is easily remembered as ‘ﬁeld
elevation’. In some parts of the world this technique is not used. For example, the
QFE of a mountain airﬁeld may be so low that it is beyond the end of the altimeter
subscale.
During a ﬂight at moderate altitude the overriding concern is clearance of terrain and
structures. These are quoted on maps as height above mean sea level (AMSL). In order
to establish the clear height above such obstacles the altimeter reference is set to QNH;
the barometric pressure in the area ‘reduced to mean sea level’. This means that the
actual barometric pressure is measured at a known elevation and the value the pressure
would have had at sea level is computed from the height and temperature. With QNH
on the subscale, the altimeter reads feet AMSL and subtracting the height of obstacles
in feet AMSL gives the clearance. QNH is easily remembered as ‘nautical height’.
Figure 7.10(b) shows a typical low-level ﬂight. The machine takes off with QFE in
the subscale to show height above the airﬁeld. Once away from the ﬁeld the altimeter
is set to regional QNH and the machine is trimmed to cruise at 2000 feet AMSL. On
the chart is a hill rising to 1200 feet AMSL and the machine will clear it by 800 feet.
On approaching the destination airﬁeld, the pilot asks for QFE and sets this on the
altimeter. This should read zero as he touches down.
Each country is divided up into altimeter setting regions which each have their own
QNH value as a function of the weather system across the country. The QNH quoted
takes into account the rate at which barometric pressure is changing. If pressure is
falling, a machine ﬂying at constant pressure altitude based on QNH would actually
descend and not have the expected clearance. QNH is adjusted upwards by the authorities to ensure that clearance is still achieved at the end of the period for which a setting
is valid even if barometric pressure falls. On a long ﬂight an altimeter setting region
boundary may be crossed. The pilot must obtain the new QNH for the area to ensure
his altimeter still reads feet AMSL. The subscale is generally calibrated in millibars
(mb) or, more recently, hectoPascals (hP) that are numerically identical. In America,
scales calibrated in inches of mercury (inHg) will be found.
For ﬂight in airways, the overriding concern is not terrain clearance, but vertical
separation between aircraft. For this reason the same reference pressure is always used
in airways. This is the pressure of the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) at
Mean Sea Level (MSL): 1013.25 mb. Older texts may use the term QNE to describe
this pressure. Aircraft ﬂying with ISA on the subscale are ﬂying at pressure altitude.
The ﬂight level is the pressure altitude with the last two digits removed. For example,

Fig. 7.10 (a) QFE is the local barometric pressure at ground level at an airﬁeld. When the subscale is set to
QFE, the altimeter reads height AGL (above ground level). (b) Once away from an airﬁeld, the altimeter may be
set to QNH. This is local pressure reduced to MSL (mean sea level) and the altimeter reads height above MSL.
As obstructions on maps are described by their height AMSL, the QNH setting allows the pilot to establish that
terrain clearance exists. QFE may be used for landing. This may be different from the QFE that was used at
take-off.

an aircraft at FL 350 is 35 000 feet above ISA MSL. Another aircraft at FL 340 would
always be 1000 feet lower whatever the atmospheric conditions. Very few helicopter
operations take place in airways, although as tilt-rotor and tilt-wing machines enter
service this will change.
It should be noted that helicopter altimeters only sense local atmospheric pressure
when the rotors are not turning. In the hover, especially in ground effect, the pressure
under the rotor disc will be appreciably above ambient. Going from ﬂat pitch on the
ground to a low hover will result in a noticeable reduction in the reading on the altimeter,
of the order of 30 feet. The effect is negligible in translational ﬂight.

Control 275

Fig. 7.11 The VSI (vertical speed indicator) is a leaky barometer that responds to a rate of pressure change.
At constant altitude the pressure in the instrument will be the same as ambient owing to the leak. In a climb,
air will try to ﬂow out of the leak and the pressure across the oriﬁce will be sensed to operate the display.

7.8 The vertical speed indicator
As its name suggests, the vertical speed indicator (VSI) displays the rate at which altitude
is changing. Whilst this can be established by looking at the speed with which the hand
of the altimeter turns, this takes some time and it is quicker to look at a separate display.
Figure 7.11 shows how the VSI is constructed. The case of the instrument is connected
to the static port of the aircraft. The mechanism includes a thin metal capsule sealed
except for a very small oriﬁce of carefully determined size. Should the aircraft climb,
ambient pressure will fall and the capsule will expand, moving a pointer across a scale.
The reduced ambient pressure will cause the air inside the capsule to ﬂow out, but the
ﬂow is slowed down by the restriction. At constant altitude, the capsule will eventually
have the same pressure inside and out, and the pointer will read zero. The faster the
ambient pressure changes the more the restriction opposes the balancing airﬂow and
the greater the deﬂection of the pointer. As it is self-balancing the VSI needs no pilot
adjustment and has no controls. The VSI is particularly useful in cruise where it should
read zero. Any discrepancy indicates that the helicopter needs retrimming to ﬂy at
constant height.

7.9 The airspeed indicator
The airspeed indicator (ASI) is connected between the forward facing pitot head and the
static vents. This arrangement cancels ambient air pressure so that it measures only the
dynamic pressure due to forward ﬂight. Dynamic pressure is proportional to air density
and to the square of the velocity. As a result the expansion of the pressure-sensing capsule is proportional to the square of the speed, and it is necessary to convert the square
law response to drive a practical scale. Figure 7.12 shows that this can be done using a
straight spring (a) whose effective stiffness increases with deﬂection. At low speeds the
whole length of the spring is active (b) and the restoring force is relatively low. When
the spring contacts a stop (c) the active length is reduced and the spring becomes stiffer.
The system does not achieve complete linearity. Practical ASIs have decidedly nonlinear scales and the designer positions the stretched part of the scale at the most useful

techniques to linearize the scale to some extent. This may include the provision of stops to make the return

range of ﬂying speeds. In a light helicopter the stiffer spring may come into operation
at about 100 mph. Pointer movement from 70 to 80 mph may be twice that from 100
to 110 mph. A further consequence of the square law is that the dynamic pressure at
low speed is very small indeed and comparable to the friction in the linkages. The ASI
is unreliable at low speeds because of the low dynamic pressures involved and because
of the effect of downwash. Thus an ASI generally has no calibrations below 20 mph.
According to the country of origin ASIs will be found calibrated in mph, knots and
kph, some have dual scales like car speedometers.
The reading of the ASI is also proportional to air density, so it will underread at
high altitude. The scale on the ASI displays indicated air speed (IAS) proportional to
density and the square of the speed. Since the rotors behave proportionally to these
parameters, IAS is the best way of displaying speed from the point of view of the
airframe. Clearly IAS is not the actual speed through the air, and for navigational
purposes it needs compensating for ambient density to give true air speed or TAS.
Density is affected by altitude and temperature. At 10 000 feet the IAS must be increased
by around 17% to compensate for density change. An increase of 10◦ C raises TAS
about 2%. If TAS, windspeed and direction are known, the groundspeed (GS) can be
calculated.
In real ASIs the scale markings are not perfect, and frequently the position of the pitot
head with respect to the hull causes errors at certain airspeeds. A calibration table is
supplied so that IAS can be corrected by looking it up on the table. The result is called
rectiﬁed or calibrated airspeed (RAS or CAS) and is the value the IAS would have
read if it were free of error. In a helicopter airspeed is relatively slow and uncertainty
about windspeed causes more error than the ASI. In this case it is probably not worth
correcting the ASI for navigational purposes.

7.10 Airspeed and altitude sensing
Airspeed and altitude are both sensed by measuring pressure, one dynamic and one
static. Both of these processes are often combined in a single unit. As was seen above,
pressure is measured using the deﬂection of a corrugated capsule. The amount of

adding friction. See text.

movement and the power available is small and it is difﬁcult to drive a conventional
encoder directly. Instead a form of electromechanical ampliﬁcation is used. Figure 7.13
shows one example. The sensing capsule is mounted on a platform that can be moved
by an electric motor. The moving diaphragm of the capsule carries only a low mass
vane or plate placed in a light beam. The light falls on differential photocells so that
very small off-centre movements of the diaphragm produce an electrical signal because
more light falls on one cell and less on the other. This signal is ampliﬁed and supplied to
the electric motor such that the motor is driven in a direction that recentres the optical
sensor. Alternate types of sensing may be used, for example a differential transformer
as will presently be described.
A motor used in this way is known as a chaser. Effectively the chasing action means
that the diaphragm of the capsule remains in the same place. Pressure changes must
then be reﬂected in the position of the motor drive, which has enough power to drive the
pressure encoder. In addition to the encoder output, the speed of the motor may be
measured to produce a rate output. When used for the altitude hold function in an
autopilot, the chaser motor may be disconnected and the signal from the optical sensor
will be used to make the aircraft climb or descend as needed to maintain altitude.
Altitude is sensed using an evacuated capsule, and means are required to allow the
appropriate reference pressure to be set. Airspeed is sensed using a capsule exposed on
one side to dynamic pressure at the pitot head and to static pressure on the other.
For automatic approach or landing systems a RADAR altimeter is a necessity. In fact
it is not an altimeter as it does not consider air pressure; it is a height meter because
it works by timing the reﬂection of a radio signal to give height AGL which is the
requirement for landing.

7.11 Gyroscopic instruments
Gyroscopic instruments are those depending on a rapidly rotating ﬂywheel for their
operation and include the direction indicator (DI), the turn and slip indicator (T + S),
also known as the turn and bank indicator, and the artiﬁcial horizon. These display, in
various ways, the attitude and heading of the helicopter. It is possible to ﬂy a helicopter
in good conditions without them, relying only on the magnetic compass for heading

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 277 — #20

278 The Art of the Helicopter
information and assessing the attitude of the machine from the view of the world outside. In poor conditions or at night the horizon may be indistinct and without attitude
clues even the ﬁnest pilot could lose control owing to disorientation. The gyroscopic
instruments provide sufﬁcient clues that in conjunction with the other ﬂight instruments the machine can be ﬂown without looking outside at all. Whilst the instruments
are optional in a VFR light helicopter, most have them ﬁtted and it is worth knowing how they operate as they could make a signiﬁcant difference if an unanticipated
deterioration in the weather takes place or if cloud is inadvertently entered.
The basic principle of the gyroscope was considered in Chapter 2. In practical instruments the gyro rotor is spun by an air jet or by an electric motor. Many light planes
have a venturi in the slipstream that generates suction. This is applied to the case of
the gyro instrument. Filtered cabin air is drawn into the instrument through a nozzle
by the suction and blows the rotor round. Clearly this arrangement is not suitable for
a helicopter as there is not necessarily a slipstream. A further alternative is to have a
vacuum pump driven by the engine. The solution adopted in most helicopters is to drive
the gyroscopes electrically. Power is fed through the gimbals by miniature sliprings.
As the operation of the gyro is dependent on the rotational speed, many gyros, but
not all, have a ﬂag coloured red or orange which swings into view if the rotor is not
running fast enough. No ﬂight action should be based on the reading of an instrument
showing a ﬂag.
If a gyroscope is mounted in gimbals and set running with the rotor axis parallel to the
earth’s surface, it will not remain in this condition due to drift. Drift has two unrelated
components. First, the gyroscope is built to ﬁnite accuracy and minute imbalances
in the gimbals and bearing friction will result in the spin axis changing slowly in an
unpredictable manner; a genuine drift. Second, as the earth is turning at 15◦ per hour
the gyro axis ﬁxed in space will display apparent drift.
Figure 7.14 shows that the effect of the earth’s rotation on apparent drift is a function
of latitude. At the equator the gyro axis and the earth’s axis are parallel and no drift
is observed. However, at the geographic pole, the full 15◦ /hr will be observed. The
apparent drift due to earth rotation is a sinusoidal function of latitude. The drift may

the full rotational rate of the earth (15◦ /hr) will be apparent. This falls to zero at the equator as a sinusoidal
function of latitude.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 278 — #21

Control 279

be modiﬁed if the gyro is in a moving aircraft. The track of the aircraft will have an
east/west component and movement in this direction will have to be added to the rate
at which the earth turns. This is known as transport error. The term transport wander
will also be found, but this is misleading as the effect is entirely deterministic.
A completely free gyro will suffer from three forms of error: an unpredictable error
due to non-ideal construction, and predictable errors due to the rotation of the earth
and to being transported with respect to the earth. In a helicopter the low airspeed and
relatively short ﬂights mean that transport error is generally insigniﬁcant.
For earth-related activities such as ﬂying, something will have to be done about drift.
The solution depends upon the application, but essentially the rigidity of the gyro is
used to offer short-term stability, whereas the long-term stability comes from elsewhere.
A gyro externally stabilized in this way is described as tied. Where the long-term stability
comes from the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, the result is called an earth gyro.

7.12 The direction indicator
The direction indicator is a gyroscopic device that is designed to overcome acceleration
errors in magnetic compasses and to be easy to read. Figure 7.15 shows the general
arrangement of a DI. The rotor axis is maintained horizontal and the shaft is mounted
in a pair of gimbals where the outer one pivots about a vertical axis. A gearing system

280 The Art of the Helicopter
instrument is turned bodily about a vertical axis, the rigidity of the gyro will keep the
gimbals ﬁxed, and so the action of moving the instrument case around them will rotate
the scale and indicate the angle through which the unit has turned.
The gyro axis is maintained horizontal by tying the gyro to the vertical gimbal ring.
In an air-driven gyro there is already a stream of exhaust air leaving the rotor shroud.
In an electrically operated gyro the rotor can be designed to act as a blower to produce
an air jet. The air stream from the shroud impinges upon a wedge-shaped plate on the
vertical gimbal ring. If the gyro axis (or the horizontal gimbal ring) is not at right angles
to the vertical ring, the airﬂow will produce an imbalanced force on the vertical ring,
tending to turn it. The direction of this force is such that it will cause the gyroscope
slowly to precess in a direction that will bring the inner ring to rest at 90◦ to the outer
or vertical ring.
As a result the gyro axis is aligned with the long-term average attitude of the helicopter
about the roll axis. Compared to the slow rate of precession in the tying process,
manoeuvres of the helicopter are very rapid and average out. In ﬂight a turn would
be accompanied by banking, but the gyro would maintain its axis because the inner
gimbal can pivot in the outer.
Although more accurate in a manoeuvre than a magnetic compass, the DI does suffer
from minor geometric errors. The outer gimbal has two sets of bearings at 90◦ , and
essentially is acting as a Hooke joint between the gyro and the display card. As has
been seen elsewhere in this volume, the Hooke joint is not a constant velocity joint,
but suffers from cyclic angular errors when the input and output axes are not parallel.
The result is that the DI reading is slightly out due to what is called gimballing error. It
should be pointed out that gimballing error is very small and disappears when straight
and level ﬂight resumes.
The occurrence of gimballing error depends on the orientation of the gyro axis with
respect to the helicopter’s yaw axis. In the general case where the gyro axis is not
transverse to the ﬂight path, a roll will cause gimballing error. In the special case where
the gyro axis is transverse, a combined roll and pitch change will be needed to cause a
gimballing error.
Figure 7.14 showed that with the DI gyro axis horizontal, the rotation of the earth
causes apparent drift at a rate given by multiplying the earth rate, 15◦ /hr, by the sine
of the latitude. For example, on the south coast of England at Lat. 51◦ N there will be
a DI earth drift rate of just under 10◦ /hr.
In some units it is possible to compensate the DI for earth rate mechanically. The inner
gimbal ring is deliberately imbalanced by a nut on an arm so that gravity produces a
slight rolling torque on the gyro. The gyro will precess this into a yaw and when correctly
adjusted the rate of yaw will be equal to the earth rate for the latitude at which the
machine is normally operated so that the drift is cancelled. In more sophisticated DIs,
there may be an adjustable earth rate compensator having a control which is set to the
current latitude and a switch to select the sense of the compensation for the appropriate
hemisphere. A latitude-dependent current is generated and sent to a torque motor in
the DI ﬁtted between the inner and outer rings. This applies torque to roll the inner
ring, but the gyro precesses this into yaw. If the correct torque is applied for the latitude,
the resultant precession rate will equal the earth rate and the DI drift will be minimal.
In principle if the groundspeed, latitude and heading are known transport error can
also be cancelled. This may be useful for ﬂying near the magnetic poles.
However, most DIs rely on periodically being reset to the same reading as the magnetic compass and are ﬁtted with a control knob which is pushed in and turned to force
the gyro round to the correct heading. Pushing in the knob also forces the gyro axis to
be at right angles to the vertical ring, a process known as caging. Clearly the machine

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 280 — #23

Control 281

must be in steady ﬂight when the DI is aligned to the compass or the gyro axis will be
incorrect and it will be set to repeat the compass turning error.

7.13 The gyromagnetic compass
More sophisticated DIs can tie themselves to a magnetic ﬂux gate compass to produce
a gyromagnetic compass which combines the best features of both devices. The ﬂux
gate compass was described in section 7.5. The tying process is heavily ﬁltered so that
compass errors during manoeuvres do not affect the reading. Gyromagnetic compasses
have the advantage that they do not need to be reset.
Figure 7.16 shows how the DI follows the magnetic compass. The signals from the ﬂux
gate compass are applied to a set of three coils encircling the shaft driving the display
card in the DI. On the shaft is a single secondary coil. When the DI is accurately aligned
with the compass, this coil will be transverse to the resultant ﬂux of the three input coils
and so no voltage will be induced in it. However, if any angular difference develops, a
signal will be induced in the secondary coil and this can be ampliﬁed and used to drive
torque motors that apply a rolling torque to the inner gimbal of the gyro. The gyro will
precess this torque into yaw so that the display card will turn, and with it the secondary

a torque motor precesses the DI until the two have the same indication.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 281 — #24

282 The Art of the Helicopter
coil. In this way the gyro is precessed until the signal in the secondary coil nulls and the
precession stops. At this point the display card will be showing the heading coming from
the compass. The gain in the system will be quite low so that the gyro follows very slowly.
In some units it is possible to rotate the three coils using a front panel variation control
so that the DI card reads true heading rather than magnetic. In most conditions tying
the DI to magnetic north is useful, but when ﬂying very close to the magnetic poles it
may be better to turn the slaving off and to rely on the earth rate and transport error
compensation only. A switch will be provided for this purpose.
A gyromagnetic compass may also form the heading reference for an autopilot. In
this case the display unit has additional controls allowing the pilot to enter the desired
heading. This is displayed with respect to the DI card markings by an indicator or bug
on the periphery of the instrument. If the autopilot is engaged and a new heading is
selected, the machine will carry out a two-minute rate turn to the new heading at which
point the bug will align with the lubber line of the DI.

7.14 The artiﬁcial horizon
The artiﬁcial horizon is a gyroscopic instrument displaying a realistic copy of what the
real horizon does for use in poor visibility. When the helicopter banks, the horizon
in the display remains parallel to the real one. When the machine dives, the displayed
horizon rises up the face of the instrument. A small symbolic aircraft on the face of
the instrument then has the same attitude to the horizon as the real one, and if the
pilot ﬂies the symbolic aircraft the real one will follow. In a machine equipped with an
autopilot, in addition to the visible display, the artiﬁcial horizon may provide attitude
output signals that are fed into the control system to stabilize the ﬂight attitude.
The gyroscope in an artiﬁcial horizon must be compensated for drift. This is done
by an erection mechanism to maintain the axis of the gyro vertical with respect to
gravity. For this reason, this type of instrument is sometimes called a vertical gyro. The
addition of gravity sensing creates what is known as an earth gyro. Figure 7.17 shows
how gravity sensing works. The rotating wheel is ﬁtted inside a case. Two small pendula
are ﬁtted to the case in such a way that they can swing in orthogonal directions. The
electrically driven rotor is ﬁtted with vanes at one end so that it acts as a centrifugal
blower. Air from the blower is arranged to leave the casing at four equally spaced points.
Each pendulum has two vanes that block or reveal the blower oriﬁces. The vanes are

Fig. 7.17 Gravity sensing is used in earth-tied instruments such as the artiﬁcial horizon. Small pendula (c) and
(d) hang in the efﬂux (b) from a blower (a) built into the gyro rotor. If the rotor axis is not vertical the pendula
will tilt and the reaction from the blower will be imbalanced so a precessive torque is created.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 282 — #25

Control 283

arranged on opposite sides of the pendulum so that if the pendulum swings one way
the area of one oriﬁce is reduced whilst that of the other is increased; the situation is
reversed if it swings the other way.
If the pendulum is central, the two oriﬁces have equal areas revealed, and the thrust
from the air jets will cancel. Should the gyro tilt with respect to gravity the pendulum
will swing away from the centre position and the jet reaction will no longer balance. The
net reaction is at right angles to the angular error, but this is exactly what is necessary
as it causes the gyro to precess and right itself. As there are two orthogonal systems
working simultaneously, the gyroscope maintains itself along the earth’s gravitational
ﬁeld. The erection system needs only to be able to work somewhat faster than the
earth rate, and so the air jets do not need to be very powerful. In fact it is better if the
erection process is slow because then momentary disturbances of the pendula caused
by manoeuvres and turbulence are simply too rapid for the gravity-sensing system to
respond to and they are ﬁltered out. In some gyros the earth tying is done by tilt switches
that operate torque motors acting on the gimbals. In more sophisticated instruments
the erection process is switched off if the tilt switches tilt by more than a few degrees
as this must be due to a manoeuvre.
As the gravity sensing is so subtle, a gyro takes about ten minutes to settle if started
up with random orientation. In order to speed the process, the instrument is ﬁtted with
a caging knob that is operated when the aircraft is level. This operates a system of cams
to force the gimbals back to the approximately correct attitude. When the cams retract,
the gravity sensing ﬁnishes the job. The caging knob should not be operated when the
machine is not level as a false attitude will be indicated. Gyros with tilt switch erection
systems may have a fast erection mode for use on the ground or in level ﬂight in which
the precession rate is increased.
Figure 7.18 shows the general arrangement of the artiﬁcial horizon. The outer gimbal
is pivoted on the roll axis of the aircraft and the inner gimbal is pivoted on the pitch axis.
The gyro axis is vertical. Movement of the inner gimbal relative to the outer operates

Fig. 7.18 In an artiﬁcial horizon, a gravity-sensing gyroscope (a) is mounted on a forked gimbal (b), which is
free to turn in the roll axis bearing (c). If the machine rolls, the horizon on card (d) will remain horizontal. If the
machine pitches, the card and gyro will remain vertical, but the card will move in the viewing window with
respect to the symbolic ‘wings’ (e). The crank (f) reverses the sense of the card movement so that when the
machine dives the ‘ground’ on the card moves up.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 283 — #26

284 The Art of the Helicopter
levers to move a large card painted with the earth at the bottom and the sky at the top.
In a dive the instrument is tipped nose down and this causes the horizon card to rise
with respect to the symbolic aircraft. In a climb the card falls. During a roll the outer
gimbal remains horizontal, as does the horizon card. The instrument effectively banks
around the card.
Clearly if a gyroscopic instrument is to work properly it must be ﬁtted in the helicopter
with the correct orientation, which is usually with the instrument face vertical. The
artiﬁcial horizon is particularly sensitive to mounting attitude and if ﬁtted to a sloping
instrument panel a wedge plate is used to keep the instrument level. Certain artiﬁcial
horizons can be adapted to work on a sloping panel. The card linkage is offset and
the caging cam is turned around the inner gimbal by the angle of tilt so that the gyro
remains vertical with the instrument tilted and the horizon in the centre of the display.
In a helicopter the attitude of the machine about the pitch axis depends on forward
speed. At high speed the nose down attitude would fool the instrument into thinking the
machine was diving. To overcome this, the symbolic aircraft is ﬁtted with an adjusting
knob that allows it to be moved up or down slightly so that at the chosen airspeed it
can be set to the displayed horizon.
The gyroscope can only maintain its rotational axis if the gimbals allow it sufﬁcient
freedom. This is true for moderate manoeuvres, but not for aerobatics. If a machine
equipped with an earth gyro performs a quarter loop so it is going straight up, the two
gimbals will become parallel and there will only be one degree of freedom. If, as this
condition of gimbal lock is approached, the machine also rolls, there will be violent
precession known as toppling as the gyro attempts to conserve momentum without the
necessary freedom. After toppling, the gyro will be useless until it has erected again. If
a gyroscopic instrument is expected to operate under aerobatic conditions, it will need
additional outer gimbals. These are servo driven from sensors on the inner gimbals so
that the latter are maintained at right angles at any attitude so that gimbal lock can
never occur.

7.15 The turn and slip indicator
The turn and slip indicator is actually two completely independent instruments but
combined in one housing as the two would be used together to make a turn. Figure 7.19
shows the mechanism of a turn indicator; actually a rate gyroscope. There is only one
gimbal pivoted on the fore-and-aft axis of the helicopter and the gyro shaft is transverse.
The gimbal is held central by a light spring and rocking of the gimbal moves a pointer
over a scale. If the helicopter turns, the gyroscope precesses and rocks the gimbal.
The faster the turn, the further the precessing gyro will be able to extend the centring
spring. A small dashpot is provided to damp the motion of the rocking gimbal. This
may consist of a piston sliding inside a cylinder having a small air bleed hole at the end.
This reduces pointer movement due to vibration or turbulence and displays the average
turn rate only. Helicopter turn indicators are generally designed to reach a scale mark
at a rate of 180◦ per minute, corresponding to the two-minute turn rate commonly
used in instrument ﬂying. As the gyro is controlled by the centring spring, no action is
needed to compensate for earth rate and the instrument has no controls.
The slip indicator is no more than a weight in a ﬂuid ﬁlled curved glass tube. In a
correctly banked turn, the apparent gravity should remain perpendicular to the cockpit
ﬂoor and the weight stays in the centre of the curved tube at the lowest point. If the
amount of yaw does not match the amount of bank, there is sideslip and this causes the
weight to slide away from the centre of the tube. Figure 7.20 shows that, in a ﬁxed-wing

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 284 — #27

Control 285

Fig. 7.19 The turn indicator is spring centred. In a turn, the rigidity of the gyroscope attempts to oppose the
turn but it is overcome by a force from the spring. The tighter the turn, the greater the spring extends and the
higher the reading. A conventional slip indicator is a curved tube containing a weight and damping liquid.

Fig. 7.20 In an aeroplane making a properly co-ordinated turn, the weight in the slip indicator remains central.

aircraft in a properly co-ordinated turn, the acceleration into the centre of the turn and
the acceleration due to gravity combine to give an apparent gravity in the cockpit that
is straight down through the ﬂoor. Thus it is possible to use a damped pendulum as a
slip indicator.
As was seen in section 5.2, the conventional helicopter cannot balance main rotor
torque with the tail rotor alone. There has to be another force in conjunction with the
tail rotor in order to create a couple. In forward ﬂight this may come from a slight rotor
tilt or from side slipping the hull or from some combination of both. The least drag is
obtained with zero slip, but in many helicopters the zero slip condition results in a hull

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 285 — #28

286 The Art of the Helicopter
that is not level in straight ﬂight. If the slip indicator is installed vertically with respect
to the hull, and if the machine is ﬂown with the slip ball centred, the result may be
sideslip, increased drag and a navigational problem because a side slipping machine is
not going the way it is pointing. In addition, certain conditions of fuel level or loading
may cause the CM of the machine to be offset to port or starboard of the centreline.
This will further affect the slip gauge.

7.16 Attitude sensing
An autopilot needs to sense the attitude of the helicopter in each axis being stabilized,
and the rigidity of the gyroscope makes an excellent attitude reference. In some cases it
is possible to use the existing vertical axis gyroscope in an artiﬁcial horizon to provide
pitch and roll data for an autopilot. When this is done, in addition to driving the visual
display the gyro contains encoders to provide electrical signals proportional to the
amount of pitch and roll.
Where high accuracy is required, a separate gyro having no display but providing
attitude signals only can be used. Clearly the location of such a device in the airframe
is subject to a good deal of freedom. If an inertial navigator is carried, the inertial
platform must be tied to the earth and so can act as a reference to provide attitude
signals in all three axes. The attitude data may be sensed by synchro generator or by
digital encoder, according to the signalling technology used.
Automatic turn co-ordination in forward ﬂight requires essentially a slip ball with an
electrical output. This is the function of a device known as a dynamic vertical sensor.
Figure 7.21 shows that it consists of a pendulum whose axis is fore and aft and which
carries a transducer such as a synchro or other encoder. The pendulum will be damped
against turbulence and vibration. In a correctly co-ordinated turn the pendulum will
not move with respect to the sensor because the direction of the acceleration will be
along the pendulum axis.
An alternative to the dynamic vertical sensor is to use a vane-type sensor to measure
the direction of motion of the hull through the air.

Fig. 7.21 The dynamic vertical sensor is essentially a slip indicator with an output signal. It consists of a
damped pendulum having a transducer.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 286 — #29

Control 287

7.17 Airﬂow-sensing devices
The helicopter differs from the ﬁxed-wing aircraft in that it can move in virtually any
direction in three dimensions and at very low speeds. This makes airspeed measurement
difﬁcult. The conventional ASI with its pitot head is only accurate when the relative
airﬂow approaches within 10–15◦ of the straight-ahead position. At greater angles, the
pressure caused by ﬂow of the rotor downwash around the hull may result in major
errors, especially at low speeds where the dynamic pressures due to airspeed are very
low. Helicopter pilots learn to treat ASI readings with suspicion or even amusement at
low speeds especially when hovering in cross- or tail-winds.
With a conventional ASI, it is impossible to establish if a zero-airspeed condition
exists, yet this is important to helicopter operations because of the possibility of entering
a vortex-ring condition. Another requirement for accurate low airspeed information is
in systems that control automatic stabilators. Special sensors have been developed for
helicopters to overcome some of these difﬁculties.
Figure 7.22 shows a system that can measure horizontal airspeed in any direction.
This consists of a rotating assembly with pitot heads on each end of an arm. The
assembly can be mounted above the rotor to turn with it, or on the hull and turned
by a motor. The dynamic pressure will only be constant if the horizontal airspeed
is zero. In all other cases there will be a sinusoidally varying difference in dynamic
pressure between the two pitots. The amplitude will represent the airspeed and the
phase with respect to the rotational phase of the arm will represent the direction. A twodimensional indicator may be used to display the fore-and-aft and lateral components
of airspeed.
Figure 7.23 shows an alternative system consisting of a small ﬁnned swivelling body
that will align itself with the downwash. This contains a pitot to measure the downwash
velocity. From the downwash velocity and the angle of the body it is possible to compute
the horizontal component of the downwash and this is the airspeed.
The slip string is a simple piece of string attached to the centre of the windscreen.
If the machine is being ﬂown without slip, the string will align with the airﬂow and
take on a vertical attitude. If there is any slip the string will turn. Despite its apparent
crudity, the slip string is a useful device because it does not suffer from the problems
of the pendulum-based slip indicator. A machine ﬂown with the slip string centred will
have lower drag than one ﬂown with the slip ball centred. This may be signiﬁcant if
power is limited. The machine will also ﬂy along its heading, making navigation easier.

Fig. 7.22 A rotating airspeed indicator that can measure airspeed in any direction down to zero. The difference
between the dynamic pressures at the two pitot heads determines the airspeed. The phase of the dynamic
pressure signals with respect to the rotation reveals the direction.

having an angular sensor drives a slip meter on the instrument panel.

7.18 RADAR sensors
The principle of radio direction and ranging (RADAR) is simply the analysis of
reﬂected radio waves. In active RADAR, the radio signals are generated at the analysis equipment, whereas in passive RADAR signals may come from other sources.
Radio signals are electromagnetic waves and these have the characteristic the way they
interact with objects is a function of the relative size of the object and the wavelength.
Very long wavelengths simply diffract around objects returning very little energy to the
transmitter, whereas short wavelengths are reﬂected more efﬁciently, hence the use of
short wavelengths in RADAR.
Figure 7.24 shows that two variables can be extracted from returned radio signals.
At (a) a pulse is transmitted and the time taken for the reﬂection to arrive will allow
the distance to the target to be computed. At (b) a continuous signal is transmitted and
any relative velocity between the target and the transmitter will cause the frequency of
the return to be shifted by the Doppler effect.
The RADAR altimeter is based on the ﬁrst principle. Despite its name, it is not an
altimeter. The transmitter and receiver are directed downwards and the signal reﬂected
from the earth is used to compute height above ground, not altitude. This is extremely
useful for terrain avoidance and for landing in poor conditions and may be used as the
actual height input to an altitude hold system.
RADAR altimeters have some limitations. When ﬂying over a tree canopy, the reading may be anywhere between ground level and treetop height. When ﬂying with an
underslung load, the RADAR altimeter may measure the length of the load cable.
Figure 7.25 shows how a Doppler RADAR works. The received signal is ampliﬁed
and multiplied by the transmitted signal in a mixer. Any difference in frequency between
the transmitted and received signals will be output by the mixer. This frequency is
proportional to the axial component of relative velocity between the transmitter and the
target. Figure 7.26(a) shows that as a practical matter, an airborne Doppler RADAR
must use a transmitted beam which is angled downwards. The forward motion of the
helicopter is not in the same direction as the beam. The system will measure the actual

Doppler shift measures velocity.

Fig. 7.25 Doppler RADAR mixes the transmitted and received signals to create a difference frequency
proportional to target velocity.

ground velocity multiplied by the cosine of the beam angle. A signal processor in the
Doppler receiver can make the necessary correction.
If two orthogonal (mutually at right angles) beams are transmitted, it will be possible
to resolve the angular difference between heading (direction of travel through the air
mass) and the track (direction of travel over the ground) from the relationship between
the two Doppler velocities. If this information is compared with the true airspeed and
the heading it will be possible to compute the wind velocity.
Manoeuvres will result in the angle of the beams changing with respect to the earth
and this must be compensated using attitude signals from a vertical gyro or with a
third beam.
Another useful characteristic of Doppler RADAR is that the number of cycles
of the signal emerging from the mixer is proportional to the distance ﬂown in the

between the outputs from the two beams.

direction of the beam. If the heading output of a gyromagnetic compass is combined
with the Doppler-derived track-to-heading angle, the true track can be computed.
Figure 7.26(b) shows that during a ﬂight in wind, the orthogonal Doppler beams will
both output distance components. The resultant of the two will give the ground distance ﬂown. This is the principle of the Doppler navigator that has the advantage of
needing no earth-based signals whatsoever.

7.19 Control signalling
Control signalling is the process of communicating the position of a mechanism from
one place to another. There are many applications of such signalling in a modern
aircraft: the position of one of the pilot’s controls may be signalled to an actuator, the
actual position of an actuator may be signalled to a feedback control system and the
attitude of an artiﬁcial horizon may be signalled to an autopilot and to a RADAR set
so that the attitude of the RADAR antenna remains stable during manoeuvres.

Fig. 7.27 Transducers used in signalling. At (a) the potentiometer or variable resistance. At (b) the synchro
outputs three AC signals as a function of the rotor angle. The LVDT (linear variable displacement transducer)
shown at (c) is a form of linear synchro. It has the advantage over the potentiometer that there is no sliding
contact and no wear mechanism.

Figure 7.27 shows some methods used for control signalling. At (a) is the potentiometer. This is a resistance that outputs a DC voltage proportional to the position of the
moving contact or wiper. The potentiometer may be rotary or linear and is simple, but
the sliding wiper introduces a wear mechanism. The remaining devices are more complex but wear free. At (b) is the AC operated synchro generator that signals rotational
angle to a synchro motor using three wires. The synchro is ideal for measuring the angle
of a joystick or side-arm controller or the reading of a compass. In the synchro there
is a rotor carrying a single coil which is fed by sliprings and brushes. Surrounding the
rotor is a set of three coils mounted at 120◦ in a star arrangement. The synchro works
like a transformer in that it must have an alternating supply. Traditionally this will be
the 400 Hz AC used in aircraft and the supply is fed to the rotor via the sliprings. The
current ﬂowing in the rotor produces a magnetic ﬁeld at right angles to the rotor shaft.
The voltage induced in each of the secondary windings depends on the angle of the
rotor. If the ﬁeld of the rotor were parallel to a given secondary, the induced voltage
would be a maximum, but if the rotor were at 90◦ to that secondary the induced voltage would be zero. The induced voltage in a given winding is proportional to the cosine
of the angle between the rotor and that winding. With three windings there must be a
unique combination of voltages for any position of the rotor.
At (c) is the linear equivalent of the synchro which is the LVDT (linear variable
displacement transducer). This is also fed with an AC excitation signal. The moveable
core alters the magnetic coupling between a pair of input coils and the output coil. The
input coils are connected in anti-phase and with the core in the central position the ﬂux
from these two is cancelled out. If the core moves off-centre the amplitude of the output
increases in proportion to the displacement. The phase of the output represents the
direction. A phase-sensitive ampliﬁer can extract a voltage proportional to the position
of the core. As the LVDT signals linear position, it is ideal for measuring the extension
of an hydraulic ram or of a ball screw actuator.
The synchro motor is almost identical to the synchro generator. The main difference
is that it contains a rotary damper to prevent it spinning like an electric motor. The

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 291 — #34

292 The Art of the Helicopter
rotor of the synchro motor is fed with the same AC drive as the synchro generator
by connecting the two in parallel. When the three windings of the synchro motor are
fed with signals from a synchro generator, they produce a resultant ﬂux direction with
which the rotor aligns.
The synchro system is capable of high resolution but the synchro motor cannot
develop much torque. If a signiﬁcant load has to be positioned remotely, the synchro
system will require power ampliﬁcation. In this case the receiving device may be a
control transformer. This is virtually identical to the synchro motor, the main difference
being that the rotor winding is not connected to the AC supply but is instead connected
to a phase-sensitive ampliﬁer. Figure 7.7 showed the principle. A motor driving the load
also turns the rotor of the control transformer. An ampliﬁer senses the signal from the
control transformer rotor and drives the motor.
The three signals from the synchro generator reproduce the ﬂux direction of the
generator’s rotor in the control transformer. If the rotor of the latter is at 90◦ to that ﬂux
direction it will produce no output. However, if there is a misalignment, say clockwise,
the rotor will produce an output which is a sine wave in-phase with the signal exciting
the synchro generator. However, if the misalignment is anticlockwise, the rotor output
will be in anti-phase with the synchro generator input. The amplitude of the rotor
output will increase with the angular error. The phase-sensitive ampliﬁer drives an
electric motor to move the load. Using the phase information from the stator, the
ampliﬁer can drive the load in the correct direction to make the angular error in the
control transformer smaller. When the rotor of the control transformer is at 90◦ to
the induced ﬁeld from the three windings the rotor output disappears and the motor
stops. In this way a signiﬁcant load driven by a motor can be controlled remotely by
the low power signal available from the synchro generator.

7.20 Digital signalling
The potentiometer, the synchro and the LVDT are analog devices in that the signals
they produce are inﬁnitely variable. Instead of analog signalling, it is also possible to
transmit control position numerically. In digital systems, a binary number proportional
to the position of the control is encoded. All of these signals may be carried by electrical
cable, leading to the marketing term ‘ﬂy-by-wire’. Digital signals can also be carried
along optical ﬁbres, leading to the term ‘ﬂy-by-light’.
Digital signalling is a technology that arrived in aviation quite suddenly and so there
is no traditional knowledge or experience base. As a result many people regard digital
signalling as little short of black magic when in fact it is based on relatively simple
principles. One of the key concepts to grasp is that digital signalling is simply an
alternative means of carrying the same information. An ideal digital signalling system
has the same characteristics as an ideal analog system such as a synchro: both of them
are totally transparent and remotely reproduce the original applied control movement
with negligible error.
Although there are a number of ways in which the position of a control can be
represented digitally, there is one system, known as pulse code modulation (PCM)
that is in virtually universal use. Figure 7.28 shows how PCM works. Instead of being
continuous, the time axis is represented in a discrete or stepwise manner. The control
waveform is not carried by continuous representation, but by measurement at regular
intervals. This process is called sampling and the frequency with which samples are taken
is called the sampling rate or sampling frequency Fs . The sampling rate is generally
ﬁxed and is thus independent of any frequency in the signal.

Control 293

Fig. 7.28 In PCM or digital signalling, the position of a control is sampled periodically and the sample is
expressed as a discrete number.

Those who are not familiar with digital signalling may worry that sampling takes away
something from a signal because it is not taking notice of what happened between the
samples. This would be true in a system having inﬁnite response rate, but no real control
system can be like this. All control signals from joysticks, actuators, gyros etc., have a
distinct limit on how fast they can change. If the sampling rate is high enough, a control
waveform can only change between samples in one way. It is then only necessary to
carry the samples and the original waveform can be reconstructed from them.
Figure 7.28 also shows that each sample is also discrete, or represented in a stepwise
manner. The value of the sample, which will be proportional to the control parameter,
is represented by a whole number. This process is known as quantizing and results in an
approximation, but the size of the error can be controlled until it is negligible. If, for
example, we were to measure the height of humans only to the nearest metre, virtually
all adults would register 2 metres high and obvious difﬁculties would result. These are
generally overcome by measuring height to the nearest centimetre. Clearly there is no
advantage in going further and expressing our height in a whole number of millimetres
or even micrometres.
The point is that an appropriate resolution can also be found for a control system, and
a higher ﬁgure is not beneﬁcial. If a conventional pushrod control system is considered,
each bearing and joint in the system has some backlash and the cyclic stick on a typical
helicopter can always move some small distance before any motion is detected at the
swashplate. If the movement step size of a digital system is of the same order as the
backlash of a mechanical system, both systems have the same accuracy.
The advantage of using whole numbers is that they are not prone to drift. If a whole
number can be carried from one place to another without numerical error, it has not
changed at all. By describing control parameters numerically, the original information
has been expressed in a way that is better able to resist unwanted changes. The amount
of backlash in a mechanical system increases with the number of ball joints and bell
cranks in a control run. The accuracy of a mechanical signalling system would decline as

294 The Art of the Helicopter
wear occurs. A digital system can transfer whole numbers from one end of the airframe
to the other without any loss of accuracy at all and will not be affected by wear.
Essentially, digital signalling carries the original control parameter numerically. The
number of the sample is an analog of time, and the magnitude of the sample is an analog
of the value of the parameter. As both axes of the digitally represented waveform are
discrete, the variations in the parameter can accurately be restored from numbers as
if they were being drawn on graph paper. If greater accuracy is required, paper with
smaller squares will be needed. Clearly more numbers are then required and each one
could change over a larger range.
Humans expect numbers expressed to the base of ten, having evolved with that number of digits. Other number bases exist; most people are familiar with the duodecimal
system using the dozen and the gross. The most minimal system is binary, which has
only two digits, 0 and 1. BInary digiTS are universally contracted to bits. These are
readily conveyed in switching circuits by an on state and an off state or in optical ﬁbres
by the two states of a light source. With only two states, there is little chance of error.
In decimal systems, the digits in a number (counting from the right, or least signiﬁcant
end) represent ones, tens, hundreds and thousands etc. Figure 7.29 shows that in binary,
the bits represent one, two, four, eight, 16 etc. A multi-digit binary number is commonly
called a word, and the number of bits in the word is called the word length. The righthand bit is called the least signiﬁcant bit (LSB) whereas the bit on the left-hand end of
the word is called the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB). Clearly more digits are required in
binary than in decimal, but they are more easily handled.
The word length limits the range of a binary number. The range is found by raising
two to the power of the word length. Thus a four-bit word has 16 combinations, and
could set a control to only 16 positions. Clearly this would not be good enough for a
ﬂight control. However, a ten-bit word has 1024 combinations, which is close to 1000.
A mechanical ﬂight control that could be positioned to one part in a thousand would
be considered remarkable.
In a digital signalling system, the whole number representing the value of the sample
is expressed in binary. The signals sent have two states, and change at predetermined
times according to some stable clock. Figure 7.30 shows the consequences of this form
of transmission. If the binary signal is degraded by noise, this will be rejected by the

receiver, which judges the signal solely by whether it is above or below the half-way
threshold, a process known as slicing. The signal will be carried in a channel with ﬁnite
bandwidth, and this limits the slew rate of the signal; an ideally upright edge is made to
slope. Noise added to a sloping signal can change the time at which the slicer judges that
the level passed through the threshold. This effect is also eliminated when the output
of the slicer is reclocked. However many stages the binary signal passes through, it still
comes out the same, only later. Control samples represented by whole numbers can
reliably be signalled from one place to another by such a scheme, and if the number is
correctly received, there has been no loss of information en route.
There are two ways in which binary signals can be used to carry control samples
and these are shown in Figure 7.31. When each digit of the binary number is carried
on a separate wire this is called parallel transmission. The state of signal on the wires
changes at the sampling rate. Using multiple wires is cumbersome and heavy, and a

single wire can be used where successive digits from each sample are sent serially. This
is the deﬁnition of pulse code modulation. Clearly the clock frequency must now be
higher than the sampling rate.
Whilst control samples can be obtained by digitizing the output of an analog control
such as a potentiometer, it is preferable to obtain samples directly in a digital encoder.
Digital encoders are a form of displacement transducer in which the mechanical position of the shaft or pushrod is converted directly to a digital code. Figure 7.32 shows
an absolute linear encoder. A grating is moved with respect to several light beams, one
for each bit of the control word required. The interruption of the beams by the grating
determines which photocells are illuminated. It is not possible to use a pure binary
pattern on the grating because this results in transient false codes due to mechanical
tolerances. Figure 7.33 shows some examples of these false codes. For example, on
moving the fader from 3 to 4, the MSB goes true slightly before the middle bit goes
false. This results in a momentary value of 4 + 2 = 6 between 3 and 4.
The solution is to use a code in which only one bit ever changes in going from one
value to the next. One such code is the Gray code ﬁrst devised to overcome timing
hazards in relay logic but is now used extensively in position encoders. Gray code can
be converted to binary in a suitable look-up table or gate array or by software in a
processor.
For digital signalling, the prime purpose of binary numbers is to express the values of
the samples representing the original control position. Figure 7.34 shows some binary
numbers and their equivalent in decimal. The radix point has the same signiﬁcance in
binary: symbols to the right of it represent one-half, one-quarter and so on. Binary
is convenient for electronic circuits, which do not get tired, but numbers expressed in
binary become very long, and writing them is tedious and error-prone. The octal and
hexadecimal notations are both used for writing binary since conversion is so simple.
Figure 7.34 also shows that a binary number is split into groups of three or four digits
starting at the least signiﬁcant end, and the groups are individually converted to octal
or hexadecimal digits. Since 16 different symbols are required in hex, the letters A–F
are used for the numbers above nine.
There will be a ﬁxed number of bits in a control sample, which determines the size of
the quantizing range. In a ten-bit sample there may be 1024 different numbers. Each

number represents a different control position, and care must be taken during encoding
to ensure that the control does not go outside the quantizing range, or it will be limited
or clipped.
In aviation many controls are bi-directional and have a centre neutral position. In
Figure 7.35 it will be seen that in a ten-bit pure binary system, the number range
goes from 000 hex, which represents the largest negative input, through 1FF16 , which
represents the smallest negative input, through 20016 , which represents the smallest
positive input, to 3FF16 , which represents the largest positive input. Effectively, the
neutral position of the control has been shifted so that both positive and negative inputs
may be expressed as positive numbers only. This approach is called offset binary, and
is perfectly acceptable where the control has been encoded solely for signalling from
one place to another.

Fig. 7.35 In a pure binary system, only positive values are possible. A bi-directional system can be obtained
by adding an offset so that neutral is half-way up the scale.

Fig. 7.36 Trying to reduce control travel by dividing all of the sample values by a constant produces an
unwanted offset.

In practice it may be required to modify the control samples between, for example,
a joystick and the associated actuator. The control may prove too sensitive and by
processing the samples a given movement of the joystick could be arranged to produce
a smaller movement of the actuator, perhaps as a function of airspeed. A small number
might be added to the samples to perform a trim function. Two control signals might
be added together to mix cyclic and collective controls into the swashplate or to mix
the output of a stability augmentation system or autopilot into the ﬂight controls.
If two offset binary sample streams are added together in an attempt to perform
digital mixing, the result will be that the offsets are also added and this may lead to an
overﬂow. Similarly, if an attempt is made to reduce the sensitivity of a control by, say,
half by dividing all of the sample values by two, Figure 7.36 shows that the offset is also
divided and the waveform suffers a shifted baseline. The problem with offset binary
is that it works with reference to one end of the range. What is needed for aircraft
controls is a numbering system operating symmetrically with reference to the centre of
the range.

Fig. 7.37 Two’s complement coding. See text for details.

In the two’s complement system, the upper half of the pure binary number range has
been redeﬁned to represent negative quantities. If a pure binary counter is constantly
incremented and allowed to overﬂow, it will produce all the numbers in the range
permitted by the number of available bits, and these are shown for a four-bit example
drawn around the circle in Figure 7.37. As a circle has no real beginning, it is possible
to consider it to start wherever it is convenient. In two’s complement, the quantizing
range represented by the circle of numbers does not start at zero, but starts on the
diametrically opposite side of the circle. Zero is midrange, and all numbers with the
MSB set are considered negative. The MSB is thus the equivalent of a sign bit where
1 = minus. Two’s complement notation differs from pure binary in that the most
signiﬁcant bit is inverted in order to achieve the half circle rotation.
Controls having limited travel, such as potentiometers and LDVTs, can also have
their outputs converted to two’s complement. Figure 7.38 shows how a real ADC
(analog to digital convertor) is conﬁgured to produce two’s complement output from,
for example, a potentiometer. At (a) an analog offset voltage equal to one-half the
quantizing range is added to the bipolar analog signal in order to make it unipolar as
at (b). The ADC produces positive only numbers at (c) which are proportional to the
input voltage. The MSB is then inverted at (d) so that the all-zeros code moves to the
centre of the quantizing range. The analog offset is often incorporated in the ADC as
is the MSB inversion. Some encoders are designed to be used in either pure binary or
two’s complement mode where the MSB inversion may be applied as required.

Fig. 7.38 Producing two’s complement from real bipolar signals. At (a) an offset of half scale is added to the
input. The offset input is converted (b) to pure binary. The MSB is inverted at (c) to produce two’s complement.

The two’s complement system allows two sample values to be added, or mixed, and
the result will be referred to the system midrange; this is analogous to adding analog
signals in a synchro differential or adding pushrod movements in a mechanical mixer.
Figure 7.39 illustrates how adding two’s complement samples simulates the control
mixing process. The waveform of input A is depicted by solid black samples, and that
of B by samples with a solid outline. The result of mixing is the linear sum of the
two waveforms obtained by adding pairs of sample values. The dashed lines depict the
output values. Beneath each set of samples is the calculation that will be seen to give
the correct result. Note that the calculations are in pure binary. No special arithmetic
is needed to handle two’s complement numbers.
It is often necessary to phase reverse or invert a control signal, for example in a
cyclic/collective mixer the lateral cyclic signal needs to be added to the collective signal
on one side of the swashplate but subtracted on the other. Using inversion, signal
subtraction can be performed using only adding logic. The inverted input is added to
perform a subtraction, just as in the analog domain. This permits a signiﬁcant saving
in hardware complexity, since only carry logic is necessary and no borrow mechanism
need be supported.
The process of inversion in two’s complement is simple. All bits of the sample value
are inverted to form the one’s complement, and one is added. This can be checked by
mentally inverting some of the values in Figure 7.37. The inversion is transparent and
performing a second inversion gives the original sample values. When a binary counter
is incremented it will eventually reach the all-ones condition. A further count will result
in an overﬂow condition. For example, if a four-bit counter is at 1111 (15 decimal) an

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 301 — #44

302 The Art of the Helicopter

extra count will result in 10 000 (16 decimal) requiring ﬁve bits. Clearly there is no
facility to handle the leading 1 in a four-bit system and so the remaining four bits will
all be zero. Consequently the count starts again. This gives a ﬁnite word length counter
a circular structure allowing it to represent the operation of an angular sensor. Using
ﬁnite word length binary, angular parameters such as magnetic heading, variation, and
track angle can be incorporated in navigational computations.

7.21 Power-assisted controls
Figure 7.40 shows the interior of an hydraulic power-assisted ram. The output rod
carries a swinging arm operating the error valve. The input is connected to the arm
by a ball joint. The error valve contains a pair of discs and is called a spool because
it resembles a ﬁlm spool. The spool controls the ﬂow of ﬂuid to the cylinder down
passages in the pushrod. If the pilot moves a control such that the input moves to the
left, the spool will slide left and the left disc will admit ﬂuid under pressure to the
right-hand side of the piston. The right disc will allow ﬂuid from the left-hand side of
the piston to return to the reservoir. The piston will move to the left under hydraulic
pressure, but in doing so it will move the upper end of the input lever to the left, and
will close the spool valve. In servo terminology, the linkage driving the spool valve is
comparing the actual load position with the desired position to produce an error.
As a result of the error the output of the ram is made to follow the input. If the
input reverses, the spool valve moves the other way and admits ﬂuid to the other side
of the piston. As the pressure is so high, only tiny discrepancies need exist between
the input and output position for ﬂuid ﬂow to occur and so there is considerable loop

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 302 — #45

Control 303

gain. Clearly the actuator body moves and the hydraulic supply needs to be fed through
ﬂexible hoses.
In hydraulic rams as the error becomes smaller the oriﬁces through which ﬂuid ﬂows
become very small and the viscosity of the ﬂuid provides damping. When the error is
zero the ﬂow is negligible and the main ram is effectively locked because there is no
path for ﬂuid to pass around the piston. As a result hydraulic actuators tend to be
self-damping and in simple systems no tachometer feedback is needed.
It will be seen from the ﬁgure that the ﬂight load is shared between the ram and pilot
effort by the proportions of the swinging arm. In the case of loss of pressure, the input
lever moves until it comes into contact with stops on the piston rod. The input force is
thereby transmitted to the output. The controls will be much heavier and will display
a slight backlash, but they are still effective.

7.22 Fully powered systems
In a fully powered system a direct mechanical connection between the pilot’s controls
and the load to be moved is pointless as without power the load could not be moved by
the pilot alone. Instead the control signals from the pilot are compared with the actual
position of the load, and any difference causes the power system to operate in such a
way that the difference is minimized.
Figure 7.41(a) shows an example of a fully powered system in which a spool valve
is operated by a balance lever which subtracts the load position from the commanded
position.
Figure 7.41(b) shows a duplex actuator which consists of two hydraulic rams in
tandem on a common pushrod. Each ram is supplied by a different hydraulic system.
If pressure in one system is lost, the other ram can continue to provide control provided
that the failed ram does not obstruct the working ram with an hydraulic lock. This can
be arranged by providing valves to allow ﬂuid to ﬂow from one side of the piston to

the other. This valve can be seen in the ﬁgure. When hydraulic pressure is available,
the valve is forced shut, but if pressure is lost the valve opens so that the functioning
actuator is not impeded.
In Figure 7.41 it would be possible to replace the pushrod from the pilot with some
other type of signalling. If electrical signalling is used, the control ram will contain an
electro-hydraulic valve (EHV) so that electrical signals can control the hydraulic power
source. Figure 7.42 shows how an electro-hydraulic valve works. The valve is pulled or
pushed by magnetic ﬁelds from the drive coils, and admits hydraulic ﬂuid to the spool
valve controlling the main ram. As ﬂuid is allowed to ﬂow, the resulting ﬂuid pressure
on the valve output is arranged to oppose the magnetic force. This tends to close the
valve. Thus the ﬂuid ﬂow rate is made roughly proportional to the electrical current in
the coil so the ram extends at a controlled speed.
Another possibility is for the mechanical pushrod input to an hydraulic actuator to
be driven by a low powered electrically driven servo. This approach may be used in
machines where stability augmentation or autopilots are optional. The electric servo
makes it possible to input control signals to a conventional hydraulic actuator.

7.23 Stability augmentation
Early helicopters were beset by weight and stability problems where solving one often
made the other worse. A further issue is that by deﬁnition there was not initially a pool
of experienced pilots to ﬂy the ﬁrst helicopters and any extra stability would be very
welcome.
The ﬂybar was an appropriate and elegant solution at the time and played a pivotal
role in the development of the helicopter, but subsequent developments have made it
obsolete in the full size, although it is still found in most model helicopters.
Early helicopter blades were relatively lightly built because power was limited. This
resulted in a rotor with low inertia having a high following rate in response to a cyclic
control input or an external disturbance. Making the blades heavier would reduce the
following rate, but the weight could not be accepted. The ﬂybar essentially stabilizes
the machine by reducing the rate at which the rotor can change its attitude. Although
the ﬂybar works, it raises the drag and complexity of the rotor head and causes a
performance penalty. Later systems were developed which sensed the machine’s attitude
using miniature gyroscopes. Correcting signals were then fed into the powered control
system. In a sense the ﬂybar was miniaturized and put in a black box.

7.24 The Bell bar
Figure 7.43(a) shows how the Bell ﬂybar system works. This was developed by Arthur
Young, using initially electrically driven models. It was subsequently used on a number
of full-sized machines including the Bell 47 and the Huey. Use is restricted to two-bladed
rotors. The ﬂybar is mounted across the rotor on a bearing parallel to the feathering

and the amount of cyclic pitch applied.

axis of the blades. The control rods from the swashplate are attached to a pair of mixer
arms pivoting in the ﬂybar. Further rods from the mixer arms then operate the pitch
control arms of the blades.
It will be seen from Figure 7.43(b) that if the swashplate remains ﬁxed, with a suitable
linkage the rotational axis of the ﬂybar effectively can become the control axis of the
rotor, because the blades tend to stay parallel to the ﬂybar. This is called a unity mixing
system. A smaller stabilizing effect is still obtained if the feathering of the blades is
some proportion of the ﬂybar motion.
The ﬂybar is inﬂuenced by dampers on a bar ﬁxed to the rotor shaft. If the ﬂybar
rotational axis and the shaft axis are different the dampers will oscillate because the
ﬂybar is effectively ﬂapping with respect to the shaft. This action tries to bring the
ﬂybar axis parallel to the shaft axis at a rate proportional to the divergence between
the axes.
If the ﬂybar is tilted in any axis, the maximum ﬂapping velocity is reached at 90◦ to
that axis. As the dampers produce a couple proportional to velocity, this couple will
be about an axis at 90◦ to the ﬂapping axis. This couple will cause the ﬂybar to precess
into alignment with the rotor shaft. Thus the ﬂybar is a gyro loosely tied to the rotor
shaft. The ﬂybar axis will align with the shaft axis when the machine is in equilibrium,
but in any manoeuvre the divergence will be proportional to the rate of change of the
attitude of the shaft axis, i.e. the roll rate or the pitch rate of the hull. Thus the angle
of the ﬂybar relative to the mast is a measure of the roll rate of the helicopter.
The ﬂybar is gyroscopic so it will tend to hold a constant rotational axis. If, in steady
ﬂight or in the hover, the tip path plane of the rotor is disturbed by a gust, the tip

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 306 — #49

Control 307

path axis and the ﬂybar axis diverge, which must result in cyclic feathering. This will
counter the disturbance and restore the attitude of the disc. The resultant helicopter is
very stable because the action of the ﬂybar resists disturbances to the disc attitude.
The action of the ﬂybar when the cyclic control is applied is also beneﬁcial. The
mixing levers also allow the ﬂybar to oppose the cyclic input from the swashplate. If
the swashplate is tilted to initiate a roll, the blades will cyclically be feathered through
the mixing levers and the roll will commence. However, the ﬂybar is measuring the
roll rate, and the ﬂybar axis will diverge from the shaft axis. In fact the ﬂybar axis
lags behind the shaft axis. This divergence applies an opposite feathering action to the
swashplate.
For a given application of cyclic control, the blade cyclic feathering will be nulled for
a given angle of divergence between the ﬂybar axis and the mast axis. As this divergence
is proportional to the roll rate of the helicopter, it follows that the roll rate actually
achieved is proportional to the swashplate tilt. Thus the rotor system is turned into
a rate control whose following rate is determined by the inertia of the ﬂybar and the
viscosity of the dampers. As the ﬂybar axis can only roll slowly, the following rate of the
rotor to the cyclic controls is reduced, giving the effect of a heavier rotor but without
the actual mass.
The response of the rotor can be adjusted by changing the degree of damping. If the
dampers are made more viscous, the following rate increases because the ﬂybar is more
powerfully tied to the shaft axis.
The action of the ﬂybar can be analysed by treating it as a servo. Figure 7.44 shows
that the swashplate supplies the desired roll rate, and the ﬂybar measures the actual

Fig. 7.44 The Bell ﬂybar acts like a servo, adjusting cyclic pitch to obtain the desired roll rate. If the ﬂybar is
tilted with respect to the mast, the dampers will gradually bring it back into alignment. The rate of response to
the controls is proportional to the degree of damping.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 307 — #50

308 The Art of the Helicopter
roll rate. The mixing levers subtract the actual roll rate from the desired roll rate to
produce the roll rate error. This applies cyclic feathering in the sense that reduces the
error. Thus the error is kept small such that the actual roll rate is equal to the desired
roll rate.

7.25 The Hiller system
The second major ﬂybar development was due to Stanley Hiller and this was used in
many of the early Hiller machines. The main difference between the Young and the
Hiller systems is that in the Hiller the ﬂybar has aerodynamic properties as well as
gyroscopic properties and so is properly called a control rotor. Figure 7.45 shows that
the control rotor is mounted transversely on a bearing as before, but there are two major
contrasts with the Young system. First, the Hiller control rotor has full authority over
the cyclic pitch of the main rotor, such that the control rotor axis completely determines
the control axis of the main rotor. Second, the Hiller control rotor has small blades or
paddles and it has feathering bearings. Pitch control arms on the control rotor lead to
the swashplate so that cyclic pitch control of the control rotor is obtained. The pilot’s
cyclic control actually ﬂies the control rotor, whose attitude will then be followed by
the main rotor.
The following rate of the control rotor can be made as slow as required by changing
its Lock number, i.e. the relationship between the mass of the paddles and their lifting
area. Thus as before, relatively light blades can be made to respond relatively slowly.
The control rotor will not respond rapidly to gusts and so the attitude of the machine
is stabilized as it is in the Young system.
The Hiller system has the advantage that the pilot only has to produce enough force
to feather the control rotor. The control forces to feather the main rotor are created by
lift on the paddles. Thus not only does the Hiller system provide following rate control

Fig. 7.45 In the Hiller system, the ﬂybar is gyroscopic as in the Bell system, but damping is aerodynamic. The
ﬂybar also provides power assistance through the application of cyclic pitch to the paddles.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 308 — #51

Control 309

and autostabilization, it also provides power-assisted cyclic control, with the penalty
of an increase in drag due to the paddles.
The Hiller control system incorporates another unusual feature in that the swashplate
works in reverse to that of a conventional helicopter. Figure 7.46(a) shows that in
order to simplify the control runs, Hiller took an arm from the non-rotating part of
the swashplate straight down to the pilot. The pilot would move the end of this arm
in the same way as he would a conventional ﬂoor-mounted cyclic stick. In order, for
example, to apply aft cyclic, the pilot would pull the end of the arm towards himself.
This, however, had the effect of tipping the swashplate down at the front. Hiller solved
this problem by connecting the rotating part of the swashplate to the control rotor with
a scissors linkage that reverses the action.
Figure 7.46(b) shows that when the swashplate tilts forwards, the control axis of the
control rotor tilts backwards as required. When the overhead control was replaced by
a conventional ﬂoor-mounted cyclic in later machines, the reversing swashplate was
retained and the cyclic pushrods were simply rigged to make the swashplate move in
the correct sense.
It is interesting that many examples of the Bell 47 and the Hiller Raven are still ﬂying,
although the Bell 47 ﬁrst ﬂew in 1943 and the Hiller in 1948. The longevity of these
designs is testimony to the original concept. The ﬂybar was also adopted in the UH-1
Iroquois, better known as the ‘Huey’ which itself achieved legendary status.

7.26 The Lockheed systems
The Bell and Hiller systems are ideal for two-bladed teetering rotors, but it is not easy
to apply them to rotors with a larger number of blades. Irven Culver at Lockheed
developed stabilizing systems to work with rotors having any number of blades. Culver
had rightly concluded that ﬂapping and dragging hinges were not necessary and set
out to build hingeless rotors. Without ﬂapping hinges, the cyclic response of a rotor
can be extremely rapid and exert huge forces on the hull. Gyroscopic stabilization was
essential to contain control response.
The Lockheed CL-475 was a ﬂying test bed that sported a variety of rotors and
stabilization systems. Initially a two-bladed rotor was used having no ﬂapping hinges
and no collective pitch control. Lift was controlled by rotor speed. Cyclic pitch was
provided by a single span-wise hinge. A ﬂybar was mounted transversely to the rotor.
This superﬁcially resembled a Bell ﬂybar, but only because of the streamlining of the
tip weights. The attitude of the ﬂybar with respect to the mast controlled the cyclic
pitch of the rotor and the pilot’s cyclic stick applied forces to the ﬂybar via springs and
the swashplate to make it precess. As the main rotor changed its attitude, pitch link
loads would make the gyro bar follow, serving the same function as the dampers in the
Bell system. A second gyro stabilized the yaw axis by controlling the tail rotor pitch.
In the Bell system some of the travel of the ﬂybar is lost in the mechanical mixer
needed to add in the cyclic control from the swashplate. The direct control of the main
rotor by the gyro in the Lockheed system allowed greater loop gain and was thus
more stable. However, the two-bladed hingeless rotor suffered from excessive 2P hop in
forward ﬂight and work concentrated on hingeless rotors with more than two blades.
In 1960 a new three-bladed rotor was designed, again having no ﬂapping hinges.
Initially, each blade had its own single-ended ﬂybar known as a gyrobar. This is shown
in Figure 7.47. In the gyrobar system, the feathering axis is not parallel to the blade,
but instead the feathering axis is swept back with respect to the blade. As was shown in
section 4.7, this causes coupling between the ﬂapping and feathering axes. If the rotor

reversing mechanism is needed between the swashplate and the ﬂybar to allow the control system of (a) to
work in the correct sense.

disc should tilt for any reason, the inter-axis coupling causes the feathering bearing
to turn slightly, and a couple is applied to the gyrobar. If a given blade is imagined
to rise, an upward couple will be applied to its gyrobar. The gyrobar will then precess
by 90◦ causing the blade pitch to increase 90◦ after the stimulus. As the blade is also
gyroscopic, the blade would respond by rising a further 90◦ after the stimulus. As a
result the blade responds at 180◦ to the stimulus and is thus stable.
Cyclic control is obtained by applying couples to the gyrobar using the swashplate.
The inertia of the gyrobar means that it will control the following rate of the main rotor.
In 1961 a ring gyro having direct control of blade cyclic pitch was ﬁtted below the
rotor. A collective pitch mechanism was also ﬁtted so that constant RPM could be
used. In this form the CL-475 was widely demonstrated and achieved a reputation for
stability that represented the state of the art at the time. The machine still exists with
the ring gyro and is at Fort Rucker at the time of writing.
Subsequently the Model 286 (XH-51) was developed. This hingeless machine initially
had three blades, but changed to four blades again for vibration reasons. The ring gyro
is replaced by a rigid four-legged ﬂybar, again directly coupled to the cyclic pitch arms
of the rotor blades such that the ﬂybar axis forms the control axis of the main rotor.
Gyroscopic rigidity of the ﬂybar means that any unwanted disturbance of the main
rotor attitude due to gusts is automatically opposed.
The Lockheed system achieves cyclic control by applying control couples to the ﬂybar
via the swashplate to make it precess in the required direction. The cyclic control system
is unlike that of any other helicopter because it provides forces, not displacements. This
is no more than a scaled-up version of the use of torque motors to erect gyroscopic
instruments as was seen earlier in this chapter.
Figure 7.48 shows that couples are applied to the ﬂybar by a system of springs. Each
of the control runs, pitch and roll, contains a pair of springs, one positive and one
negative. With the cyclic stick at neutral, the geometry is such that if the swashplate
moves because the ﬂybar has tilted, one spring is compressed and the other extends

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 311 — #54

312 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 7.48 In the Lockheed system the ﬂybar is caused to precess by the application of couples. A double-spring
arrangement allows the precession without interference from the other cyclic axis. See text.

by a similar amount. The springs will balance each other over a signiﬁcant range of
movement of the ﬂybar. Thus if the ﬂybar tilts it will not experience a restoring force
from the controls. However, if the controls are displaced from neutral, the spring
imbalance is upset and the result is a couple applied to the ﬂybar.
Control is achieved as follows. If the pilot wishes to roll the machine, this can only be
done if the ﬂybar is made to roll. As the ﬂybar is gyroscopic, it can only be made to roll
by applying a couple in the pitch axis. Consequently the controls are rigged such that
the roll cyclic pushrod applies a pitch couple to the ﬂybar through the spring system.
The ﬂybar will sense this couple and correctly precess with a 90◦ lag to perform the
commanded roll. The ﬂybar is allowed to precess in this way by the balanced springs
in the pitch pushrod.
The hingeless model 286 was aerobatic and performed loops and rolls with ease,
whilst remaining easy to ﬂy. Essentially the same control approach was adopted in
the ﬁrst models of the Lockheed Cheyenne compound helicopter (see Chapter 9). The
high speed of this machine increased the loads that the rotors fed into the gyro through
the pitch links, undermining gyro authority. The solution was the system shown in
Figure 7.49. Lockheed called this the AMCS (advanced mechanical control system).
Here the gyro has been moved inboard, below the transmission. The absence of an
external ﬂybar reduces drag. The gyro is ﬁtted with a swashplate through which it
controls the mechanical inputs to hydraulic actuators. These provide an irreversible
control over the cyclic pitch so that pitch link forces from the blades cannot reach the
gyro. The hydraulic actuators operate a spider that passes through the centre of the gyro
and the transmission and emerges above the rotor head where it operates pitch links.
The gyro is supplied with couples by the pilot’s cyclic control using the positive and
negative balanced spring system as before. These are not shown in the diagram. Having
eliminated pitch link loads with the hydraulic actuators, the gyro is now made to follow
the hull attitude using springs attached to the mast.
Lockheed’s AMCS represented the ultimate mechanical helicopter gyrostabilizer,
but even as it was being tested, systems were being developed using miniature gyros
and electronic ampliﬁcation and the future of helicopter stabilization would lie in that
direction.
Flybars are still found in ﬂying model helicopters. Models are harder to ﬂy than the
full size and the ﬂybar allows a welcome degree of stability for the pilot who won’t have

the same level of training as his full-size counterpart. Beginners often ﬁt extra weights to
the ﬂybar to reduce the following rate even further. The ﬂybar also allows the use of inexpensive and lightweight wooden blades whose following rate alone would be too fast.
The Bell system was difﬁcult to replicate in miniature because of the hydraulic
dampers, and the pure Hiller system was found to produce a very low following rate
in models. As a result a hybrid system combining both and aptly called the Bell-Hiller
system evolved. This uses the cyclic mixing of the Bell bar, as well as the Hiller paddles
and control rotor feathering. There are thus three rods coming from the swashplate: one
to each of the ﬂybar mixer arms, and one to feather the control rotor. This arrangement gives a good balance between stability and response, although the number of
links involved makes it look like a dog’s dinner. The falling cost of the piezo-electric
gyroscope and its minute size mean that the ﬂybar can now be eliminated in the model
helicopter.

7.27 Autopilots and AFCS
Autopilots vary in complexity, but the general goal is that the pilot is relieved of the
need to maintain some parameter of the ﬂight. In a helicopter it is possible to begin
with stabilization of the roll axis only, and then add extra features. Automatic control
of the tail rotor allows balanced turns and ﬂight at minimum drag. Control of the pitch
axis allows the airspeed to be held, and altitude can be held with collective control.
Some systems can achieve a stable hover in a ﬁxed location without pilot intervention.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 313 — #56

314 The Art of the Helicopter
Achieving any or all of this requires an intelligent combination of ﬂight parameter
sensing, error measurement, power-operated controls stabilization and ergonomics. In
addition to these basics there are some additional criteria. In the same way that two
pilots cannot simultaneously have control, it is not possible for a human pilot and an
automatic system to have full authority over the helicopter at the same time.
In stability augmentation systems, also called AFCS (automatic ﬂight control systems), pilot and AFCS share control so that the pilot actually ﬂies the helicopter but
the added inputs from the AFCS make the helicopter follow the pilot’s wishes more
readily.
In simple autopilots there may be no control sharing at all and some mechanism
needs to be provided so that the pilot can engage or disengage the autopilot so that one
or other has full authority. These control reconﬁgurations must take place smoothly
so that there is no sudden disturbance of the machine when the autopilot engages or
disengages. Clearly safety is paramount and autopilots must use extensive interlocking
so that they will not engage if correct conditions are not present and so that they will
disengage and hand back control to the pilot in the case of a failure. In a simple system
the servo output is physically disconnected from the controls when the pilot has control,
but is connected by a clutch when the servo has control. Clearly the clutch is either
engaged or disengaged and so this is not a control sharing arrangement and would not
be appropriate for an AFCS.
An autopilot that maintains the machine on an absolutely stable course is in one sense
ideal, but in practice the course or altitude needs to be changed from time to time. If
the autopilot had to be disengaged and re-engaged every time a course change was
required its value in reducing pilot workload would be diminished. Thus it is necessary
to provide a means whereby the pilot can direct the ﬂight through the autopilot. In
ﬁxed-wing practice this happens relatively infrequently and it is adequate to give the
pilot an auxiliary set of control wheels or knobs which are used to direct the autopilot
to new ﬂight conditions without touching the main controls.
Figure 7.2 showed ways of dividing control between a servo and a pilot. Either a
series or parallel arrangement can be used to share control between a small electric
servo and the pilot on the mechanical input to a conventional hydraulic actuator. This
approach is appropriate if the AFCS or autopilot are optional equipment because the
same hydraulic actuator can be used with or without the servo. Where the autopilot
is standard equipment, the electric servo can be dispensed with. Figure 7.50 shows
a parallel-connected hydraulic actuator designed to allow full control authority by
the pilot with the autopilot disengaged and full autopilot authority when engaged.
Fluid ﬂow to the main ram is controlled by one of two spool valves. One of these
is mechanically operated by pushrod from, for example, the cyclic stick to give pilot
authority. The other is operated by electro-hydraulic valve (EHV) to give autopilot
authority. Note that the ram is grounded to the airframe and the body of the actuator
moves.
Figure 7.50 shows that with the autopilot disengaged the EHV and its spool valve
are isolated from the main ram by the autopilot select valve which is closed by spring
pressure. If the pilot moves the input pushrod this will displace the manual spool valve
and admit ﬂuid to the ram so that the actuator moves bodily (‘follows up’) until the
spool valve is in the neutral position again. In this mode the system is working as a
conventional power-assisted actuator as was described in section 7.21.
Provided all of the interlock conditions are met, when the pilot engages the autopilot,
the engage interlock output signal operates a solenoid valve admitting hydraulic pressure to a cylinder. This drives a tapering lock pin that moves the manual spool valve
to the neutral position, locking it to the actuator body so that no relative movement is

Control 315

Fig. 7.50 With the autopilot disengaged, the pushrod from the pilot’s controls operates the spool valve upper
right. With the autopilot engaged, the solenoid valve admits pressure to the engage piston which moves up,

possible. The second opens the autopilot select valve connecting the EHV spool to the
main ram.
Now the autopilot can move the control by supplying a signal to the EHV and can
measure the control position using the feedback signal from the LVDT in the ram.
Note that as the pilot’s controls are locked to the actuator body by the engage cylinder,
they will move as the autopilot operates, giving the pilot conﬁrmation that the machine
is literally ﬂying itself.
Two nested feedback loops are involved here. The outer loop consists of the attitude
gyro to produce an error if the machine turns around the stabilized axis for any reason.
The attitude error will compensate for factors such as the moment of inertia of the
helicopter about the controlled axis and will then be fed to the actuator loop. The
actuator loop converts the attitude error into a control movement in such a sense that
the error is cancelled. The actuator feedback loop stabilizes the controls and gives the
servo stiffness against ﬂight loads. The machine will maintain the attitude dictated by
the gyro indeﬁnitely.
When the autopilot is engaged it has full authority. If the pilot tries to move the
controls of a parallel system, the stiffness of the hydraulic actuator will oppose him.
The LVDT will sense an unwanted movement and the autopilot will operate the EHV
to oppose it. Instead the autopilot control panel carries knobs the pilot can turn to give
the autopilot a new reference. Effectively the pilot’s control knob adds an offset to the
output of the reference sensor. For example, if the pilot wished to make a constant rate
turn, he would set the turn control knob to an appropriate angle. This would add an
offset to the roll axis gyro output that the autopilot would sense as an attitude error. The
autopilot would roll the helicopter until the attitude error was apparently cancelled.
Thus only a 5◦ bank angle signal from the gyro would cancel a −5◦ bank input from
the control knob. The helicopter would indeﬁnitely remain at a bank angle of 5◦ and

present.

make a constant rate turn. Note that a hazard could exist if the autopilot were to be
engaged with the control knobs inadvertently set away from neutral. Accordingly the
control knobs have centre detents that operate interlock switches so that engagement
is impossible unless the control knobs are in a safe position.
Figure 7.51 shows an illustrative autopilot interlock. A number of conditions must
be met before power can reach the engage relay. All necessary power must be present,
ﬂight directors must be off, the gyros must be erected and the control knobs must be
neutral before the engage switch receives power. The engage switch is spring biased to
return to the off position, but if all the interlock conditions are met it will be held in the
engage position by a solenoid. When the engage switch is operated this feeds power to
a relay which applies power to the solenoid, holding the switch in the engaged position.
If the interlock conditions are not met the engage switch will return to the off position
as soon as it is released.
The relay has further contacts which bypass the control knob centre switches so that
these can subsequently be moved. Power is also fed to the autopilot solenoid in the
actuator to enable the EHV. If while the autopilot is engaged any autopilot interlock
condition fails, the holding current to the engage switch will be interrupted and the
switch will spring back to the off position. The pilot may also disengage by pressing a
button on the control column to break the holding current.
In the modern AFCS, the control knobs have been dispensed with. Instead the autopilot reference can be changed intuitively using the normal controls. When the autopilot
is engaged, in a traditional system the manual controls are locked and any attempt to
move them would be met by the rigidity of the actuator. However, if a force sensor is
ﬁtted in the control stick or in a pushrod it is possible to sense that the pilot is trying
to move the stick. Figure 7.2 showed that the stick force signal can be used to modify
the AFCS reference attitude so that the AFCS acts to implement the new attitude. In
doing so, the AFCS moves the pilot’s stick. When all of the parameters are correctly
set, the pilot’s stick moves by virtually the same amount for a given manoeuvre with

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 316 — #59

Control 317

or without the AFCS. Systems of this type are intuitive and much more appropriate
for helicopters which are generally ﬂown at lower altitude and in closer proximity to
potential hazards. Such autopilots can be left engaged at all times. If the pilot wishes
to perform an emergency manoeuvre, it is not necessary to disengage the autopilot;
an instinctive movement of the controls is all that is needed. The autopilot acts as an
AFCS and makes the machine execute the manoeuvre more accurately. However, if a
small dead-band is incorporated in the stick transducer, the autopilot can sense when
the pilot has released the stick and will then maintain the last attitude indeﬁnitely.
An autopilot that can only maintain attitude is not enough. For prolonged use the
ability to maintain airspeed and altitude is also required. For instrument landing the
ability to maintain a speciﬁed rate of descent is essential, as is the ability to move
smoothly from altitude control to descent control as the glide slope is entered.
An encoding altimeter as described in section 7.10 produces an actual altitude signal
and this is subtracted from the desired altitude set on a dial by the pilot. The resulting
altitude error will be cancelled by climbing or descending using the collective control.
When cruising at a ﬁxed altitude the necessary rates of climb and descent will be very
small, but if the pilot directs the system to a new altitude, a signiﬁcant rate of climb
may result. In the absence of a stabilator, this will increase the downwash on the tail
plane and give an aft trim effect. However the vertical axis gyro will sense this as an
attitude error and try to cancel it with forward cyclic. This will produce undesirable
mast bending and vibration. A solution is to feed a small proportion of the collective
climb command across to the cyclic system to modify the pitch axis reference allowing
a slightly tail down attitude for the duration of the climb.
The climb will also require more torque and although the yaw control of the autopilot
would handle this a better result may be obtained if the measured torque is fed into the
yaw system.
Airspeed is easily obtained from the dynamic pressure at the pitot head. In a sophisticated system, the static pressure may also be used to compensate the indicated airspeed
(IAS) to true airspeed (TAS). The pilot enters the desired airspeed on a dial and a subtraction produces the airspeed error. An increase in airspeed requires the application
of forward cyclic to tilt the thrust vector, an increase in collective pitch to maintain
altitude, a change of lateral cyclic trim because of inﬂow and a change of tail rotor
pitch because of the increased torque.
In a simple system the airspeed control might simply apply a forward pitch command
to the vertical attitude reference. The resulting loss of height would then be sensed by the
altitude hold system that would increase collective to maintain height. The increased
torque would cause the yaw stabilizer to operate and the roll attitude would be held
against inﬂow changes by the roll axis stabilization. However, all of these changes
could take some time to stabilize. Instead of letting an error occur and then allowing
the automatic system to cancel it, it is more accurate to anticipate the error by issuing
an appropriate command. This is known as feedforward. For example, if the amount
of tail rotor pitch needed to cancel torque is known for all combinations of power and
airspeed, then if a power change is commanded, the appropriate pitch change can be
added directly to the tail rotor. In this way the tail would not yaw at all during a power
change unless the feedforward had not been correctly assessed. Part of the development
phase of an autopilot system is to map the feedforward parameters over the entire ﬂight
envelope.
Feedforward of this kind may be used in manually controlled helicopters. For example, the collective lever position can usefully be linked to the tail rotor pitch. An increase
in collective pitch will require more rotor drive torque and a corresponding increase
in tail rotor pitch. By passing the tail rotor cables over a system of pulleys operated

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 317 — #60

318 The Art of the Helicopter
by the collective lever, the amount of pedal input needed, for example when entering
autorotation, is reduced.
Fast forward ﬂight requires a combination of forward cyclic to oppose the advancing/retreating lift difference and raised collective to handle increased inﬂow. In some
helicopters, as the collective lever is raised a degree of forward cyclic may automatically
be applied to reduce the amount of retrimming needed.

7.28 Coupled systems
Once an autopilot is available which is sensitive to external direction, automatic navigation becomes possible. Using inertial sensing, radio navigation, Doppler or other
means the course can be corrected automatically to bring the machine to a desired
destination. This is known as coupling and a unit known as a ﬂight director allows the
pilot to select which control source is coupled to the autopilot.
In the heading (HDG) position of the ﬂight director, the yaw reference for the autopilot becomes the magnetic-compass-locked DI such that the helicopter will maintain
a ﬁxed magnetic heading. In the VOR position of the ﬂight director, the yaw reference
becomes the bearing of a VOR (VHF omni-range) beacon so that the machine can
ﬂy directly towards (or away from) the beacon. Figure 7.52 shows that a VOR beacon
radiates in the VHF aircraft band and is modulated with two low frequency sinusoidal
signals. One of these is radiated in the same way in all directions, whereas the relative
phase of the other signal is a function of the direction of radiation. The in-phase condition is aligned with magnetic north and the phase lag is equal to the magnetic bearing
on which the radiation leaves the beacon. The beacon also transmits its identifying
signal in Morse code.

Fig. 7.52 In the VOR (VHF omni-range) system there are two transmitted signals. One of these is the same in
all directions whereas the phase of the other is a function of direction. The receiver can determine the direction
along which the transmitter was sending and the bearing of the transmitter must be the reciprocal of this.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 318 — #61

Control 319

Thus if a VOR receiver detected a 90◦ lag in the signals, this would indicate that
the receiver lay on a bearing of 90◦ from the beacon. The beacon would then be at
270◦ with respect to the receiver. A cockpit indicator makes this reciprocal indication
automatically. In order to ﬂy along a selected radial, the pilot turns the omni-bearing
selector knob on the display until the desired radial heading is at the top. If the autopilot
is now coupled to the VOR receiver, should the track deviate from the required radial,
a phase change will be picked up which will modify the roll reference of the autopilot
until the correct radial is being ﬂown. This will be indicated when the deviation pointer
on the display points straight up to the selected radial heading. The display will also
indicate whether ﬂight is to or from the beacon.
The signals become erratic as the beacon gets very close. Consequently the VOR
coupling is disabled automatically when this condition is sensed and the ﬂight director
uses magnetic heading to continue ﬂight until the beacon is behind the machine when
VOR coupling will resume with the ‘from’ indicator showing.
Figure 7.53 shows how an ILS (instrument landing system) works. There are four
transmitters associated with each landing site. The localizer is sited at the far end of

Fig. 7.53 An ILS installation. The localizer guides the aircraft horizontally onto a path which aligns with the
runway. The glide slope beams make the altitude a suitable function of distance so the aircraft descends at the
correct angle to the threshold. The markers tell the aircraft how far it is to touchdown.

“helic - CHAP07” — 2003/11/22 — page 319 — #62

320 The Art of the Helicopter
the runway and transmits a pair of beams that are equally off the axis of the correct
approach path. These are sensed with equal strength when a correct approach is being
made. The glide slope transmitter is sited at the approach end of the runway. This also
radiates two beams, this time equally off axis with respect to the ideal glide slope. These
two beams are sensed with equal strength on the correct glide slope. There are also two
highly directional antennae radiating beams directly upwards into the approach path.
These are the outer and inner markers.
In order to make an instrument approach the helicopter will initially be on autopilot
ﬂying with altitude hold. Once in the vicinity of the approach path, the ILS receiver
is tuned to the correct frequency and once identiﬁed the autopilot will be coupled to
the locator using the LOC position of the selector. The locator alone is not enough
to ensure a correct approach and the desired heading of the autopilot needs to be set
with the heading of the runway. In this mode the autopilot is inﬂuenced by both the
localizer signal and the heading error.
As Figure 7.53 shows, the heading could be correct but the helicopter could be
approaching parallel to the runway. In this case the heading error would be zero but
the localizer error would be issuing a steer left command. The machine will steer left
until the localizer error balances the heading error. As the approach path is acquired,
the localizer error becomes smaller and so the balancing heading error also gets smaller.
The result is that as the machine ﬂies onto the localizer beam centreline it will adopt
the correct heading with both errors zero.
The machine will then ﬂy along the beam centre with altitude hold still on. At some
point the receiver will intercept the glide slope beams. The point at which this occurs
will depend on the altitude. When the glide slope beams are detected, the autopilot
coupling must be set to GS (glide slope) mode. The horizontal coupling is unchanged,
but the altitude hold is disabled and replaced with coupling from the glide slope receiver.
The glide slope information will act on the autopilot by reducing the desired altitude
if the machine is above the beam and increasing it if it is below. The result is that
the helicopter descends down the glide slope. As the ﬂight path is already aligned
with the localizer beam, the helicopter must be on a direct course for the glide slope
transmitter.
The markers indicate the progress of the approach. The outer marker is about four
NM from the threshold and transmits continuous Morse dashes. The inner marker is
about 3500 feet from threshold and transmits alternating dots and dashes.
Using the ILS transmitters the helicopter can make an automatic approach. A
machine without an autopilot could make a manual instrument approach with the
pilot using left/right and up/down indicators to ﬂy down the glide slope. In the case of
an autopilot failure the pilot could elect to continue the approach manually in this way.
At some point the so-called decision altitude is reached. In the case of a manual
instrument approach or an automatic approach with a single channel autopilot, if the
landing site is not visible by the time the decision altitude is reached, the landing must
be aborted. Only a suitably equipped machine may carry on to make a blind landing.
Such a machine must carry a triply redundant voting autopilot, a RADAR altimeter
and Doppler RADAR to measure groundspeed. A pressure altimeter is simply not
accurate enough. At a RADAR height of a few hundred feet, the constant glide slope
and airspeed are both modiﬁed to produce a ﬂare. The disc attitude is pitched back to
slow the machine down and collective is lowered to prevent zooming.
As RADAR height falls, forward speed control is switched from dynamic pressure to
Doppler RADAR so the groundspeed can be brought to zero a little before RADAR
altitude reaches zero. This gives time for the hull to level before touchdown which will
be programmed to be within the landing gear limit.

7.29 Fault tolerance
In feedback systems an error is ampliﬁed to operate a control. In normal operation this
makes the error smaller. However, if there is a failure the error does not get smaller. In
the case of an attitude stabilizer controlled by vertical gyro, if the roll attitude signal
from the gyro failed and went to an arbitrary value, this would result in a massive roll
error which would apply full roll control in an attempt to correct it. This is known as a
hardover and is an unfortunate failure characteristic of all feedback systems. In practice
equipment has to be designed to prevent hardover failures compromising safety. In
a simple approach the authority of the automatic pilot is limited so that it cannot
apply full control. Slipping clutches may be present in the controls so that the pilot
can overcome the incorrect forces and regain control. In more sophisticated systems
extensive monitoring is carried out. If a signal deviates from the range of levels in which
it normally operates, the signal may be clamped to a null value to prevent a hardover
and the autopilot will be disengaged.
In military helicopters natural parts failure is not the only problem. The designer has
to consider that the helicopter may come under ﬁre and will take steps to allow control
to be retained despite a reasonable amount of damage. In practice this means retaining
control after hits from rounds of up to half-inch calibre.
The ﬁrst line of defence is redundancy. Duplicated hydraulic systems are essential,
but it is important to run the pipes far apart so that a single round cannot rupture both
systems. The location of twin engines spaced widely apart in the Apache is another
example of this philosophy. Mechanical control signalling is vulnerable to small arms
ﬁre as a single round can sever a pushrod. It is much harder to disable a multiply
redundant digital signalling system which takes different routes through the airframe
and where the processing power is distributed in small units all over the airframe. In
fact some attack helicopters use the mechanical signalling only as a failsafe in case
the ﬂy-by-wire fails. Where control paths cannot be separated, as for example near the
pilot’s controls, the armour plating which protects the pilot will also be employed to
protect critical parts of the control system.
Redundant hydraulic actuators have the additional problem that the failed actuator
may be jammed due to impact distortion or a round lodged in the mechanism. In this
case the remaining actuator will be unable to move the jammed control. The solution
is to construct actuators with frangible pistons. In the event of an actuator seizure, the
working actuator can develop enough thrust to break the jammed piston free of the
actuator rod.
Where hydraulics are concerned, it is clear when a failure has occurred, and so it is
equally clear which actuator should retain authority. However, in electrical signalling
systems a failure in a signal processor could result in an entirely spurious voltage or
digital code being output. This could have any value over the whole control range.
If there are only two control systems it is impossible to know which is giving the
right answer. The solution here is triplication where there are three separate systems
comparing the actual position with the desired position. In this case a single failure will
result in one actuator drive signal being different from the other two. A comparison or
majority voting system can determine which signal is out of step and disable it.
As with the hydraulics, electrical power sources must be duplicated. Critical electrically powered devices may be fed by multiple sources using blocking diodes. A voting
signal processor can take power from the battery wiring or from both generators. If
any power source fails its voltage will fall and the diode will reverse bias and block
any power drain so that power is still available with any one source still functioning.

322 The Art of the Helicopter
There is a good parallel here with the use of one-way clutches and multiple engines.
The one-way clutch is a mechanical diode.
There can be more than one voting unit in a real system. The pilot’s joystick may be
ﬁtted with multiple encoders and a voting system to determine if one has failed. The
LVDTs on the hydraulic actuator may have the same system so that reliable feedback
signals are available. The outputs of the multiple signal processors will also be subject
to voting. In this way the probability of control loss due to natural parts failure is
rendered inﬁnitesimal and real protection against battle damage is provided.
When redundancy, electronic processing, automatic stability, ﬂight direction and
powered controls are combined, remarkable systems can be realized. It is not inconceivable that future attack helicopters would have the ability to ﬂy themselves home in
the event that the crew are disabled.

Helicopter performance

8.1

Introduction

Helicopter performance may be assessed in a large number of areas and as these interact
to a considerable extent it is difﬁcult to categorize. As helicopters are expensive to
operate in comparison with aeroplanes, economic performance is important. Factors
such as the fuel consumed, parts worn out and maintenance needed determine the
operating cost that is generally calculated on an hourly basis. Operating cost will be
assessed by commercial users in proportion to payload. Clearly such economy will only
be realized if the machine is fully loaded. Operators will consider machines that offer
a payload close to their typical requirement in order to avoid the poor economics of
ﬂying partly loaded. In the case of privately owned machines, the payload may be little
more than the pilot and passengers, but here different economics apply as the cost of
ﬂying may be offset against time saved. In the case of military operators, economics
may not be the overriding concern.
Operational performance may be taken to include factors such as the range, airspeed
and altitude that can be obtained with various payloads. As the advantage of the
helicopter is its ability to hover, the greatest altitude that can be reached in forward
ﬂight is somewhat academic and less important that the altitudes at which the machine
can hover in and out of ground effect at various weights. Hover out of ground effect
(HOGE) altitude is the highest altitude at which the machine can take off vertically,
and will be lower than the hover in ground effect (HIGE) altitude. This is the highest
altitude at which the machine can get into the hover, which would allow a running
take-off if a sufﬁciently unobstructed area is available. These altitudes, and many other
performance factors, are functions of air temperature. If valid comparisons are to be
made, test results must be presented in a way that eliminates atmospheric variables.
The necessary techniques will be discussed shortly.
Tactical performance may include the manoeuvrability of the machine. Many aspects
of this are determined by the load factor, although the power of the tail rotor controls
the yawing ability and the ability to hover in crosswinds. Associated factors are the
range of positions the CM may take and the weight of underslung load that can be
lifted. Military and coastguard users ﬁnd these aspects of performance more important
than commercial users. Achieving high load factor and high tail rotor power may
raise weight and operating costs that a commercial operator cannot tolerate. In some
cases there are variants of a basic machine each of which is optimized for a particular
market. There will be exceptions in the case of specialist operators. Helicopters designed

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 323 — #1

324 The Art of the Helicopter
for underslung delivery of stores by the military may be well suited to logging or
construction of ski lifts.
Performance and safety are closely related. Operating an aircraft outside its designed
performance envelope may result in excessive stresses that can cause damage or even
failure. Consequently during the development of a machine, extensive tests are needed
to establish just what these limits are. These limits are published in the ﬂight manual
in order that pilots are aware of them. A helicopter’s performance can be measured
in terms of factors that contribute to safety. The degree of stability may affect pilot
workload and compromise safety on long ﬂights in poor conditions. If it is intended
to operate a helicopter in IFR, the stability performance may have to be improved by
passive or active means. Performance is important not just under normal conditions,
but also under abnormal conditions. Autorotation performance becomes important
in the case of power loss. In twin-engine machines the performance with one engine
inoperative (OEI) is crucial if the safety beneﬁt of two engines is to be more than an
illusion. The ability of a helicopter to continue ﬂight under icing conditions is also
a performance factor.

8.2

The atmosphere

The atmosphere is the medium in which helicopters ﬂy but it is also one of the fuels
for the engine and the occupants breathe it. It is a highly variable medium that is
constantly being forced out of equilibrium by heat from the sun and in which the
pressure, temperature, and humidity can vary with height and with time and in which
winds blow in complex time- and height-variant patterns. The effect of atmospheric
conditions on ﬂight is so signiﬁcant that no pilot can obtain qualiﬁcations without
demonstrating a working knowledge of these effects.
The atmosphere is a mixture of gases. About 78% is nitrogen: a relatively unreactive element whereas about 21% is oxygen which is highly reactive. The remainder is
a mixture of water in the gaseous state and various other traces. The reactive nature
of oxygen is both good and bad. The good part is that it provides a source of energy
for life and helicopters alike because hydrocarbons can react with oxygen to release
energy. The bad part is that many materials will react with oxygen when we would
rather they didn’t. Chemically, combustion and corrosion are one and the same thing.
The difference is based on the human reaction to the chemical reaction.
Gases form the highest energy state of matter in which the molecules are no longer
bound together strongly as in solids or weakly as in liquids but instead are free to
rush around at a high speed that is a function of absolute temperature. The countless
collisions between gas molecules and any non-gaseous object result in pressure at the
interface. Pressure is measured by physicists and by engineers in units of force per unit
of area using imperial units of pounds per square inch or SI units of Newtons per
square metre. At sea level, the atmosphere exerts a pressure of about 15 pounds per
square inch and has a density of about 0.075 pounds/0.002378 slugs per cubic foot,
or in metric units about 100 000 Newtons per square metre with a density of 1.225 kg
per cubic metre. Over the years, many other units of pressure have evolved, some from
meteorology. One of these is the bar (after barometry) where one bar is the average
atmospheric pressure at the place where the bar was deﬁned. In practical use, the bar is
divided into 1000 millibars. The bar is slowly being replaced by a numerically identical
unit known as the hectoPascal (hPa). The bar and hPa are commonly used in aviation
altimetry. The principle of the mercury barometer is that atmospheric pressure supports
a column of mercury exposed to a vacuum at the top. Consequently the length of the

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 324 — #2

Helicopter performance 325

column is proportional to pressure and can be expressed in inches or cm of mercury. At
sea level a reading of about 26 inches of mercury is obtained. This unit may be found
in use in altimeters originating in the United States.
The gas law states that the product of pressure and volume is proportional to temperature. Reducing the volume means that external work has to be done to oppose the pressure. This work increases the temperature of the gas. The Diesel engine obtains ignition
in this way. Conversely if the volume is increased, work is done by the gas and the temperature must fall. This is why carburettors are prone to icing on part throttle because
the air expands on entering the manifold. Air conditioners work in the same way.
If the volume is ﬁxed, as temperature rises, the velocity of the molecules increases
and so the impact at each collision with the walls of any container is greater and the
pressure rises. Alternatively the same pressure can be exerted in a given volume with
a smaller mass of gas. Thus in the atmosphere where pressure increases can be released
by free movement, the result of an increase in air temperature is that the density goes
down. Density is also affected by humidity. Water molecules are heavier than those of
atmospheric gases and increase the pressure due to molecular collisions. Thus in the
presence of water vapour a given pressure can be sustained with a smaller mass of air
and the density goes down.

8.3

International Standard Atmosphere

In order for meaningful comparisons to be made between various test results, it is
important to eliminate variations due to atmospheric conditions. The International
Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is a deﬁned set of ﬁxed conditions, somewhere within the
spread of conditions found in practice. When a test is made, the actual atmospheric
conditions are measured. Using the laws of physics, it is possible to calculate the effect
of every difference between the actual conditions and ISA. If all results are corrected in
this way, they can be presented with respect to ISA and as a result can immediately be
compared with any other results obtained in the same way. Similarly, if the performance
of a machine is deﬁned in the ﬂight manual with respect to ISA, it is possible to correct
for the actual conditions and predict the real performance that can be expected.
In the ISA, pressure and temperature at mean sea level (MSL) are deﬁned, along
with standardized rates at which these change with height. Relative humidity (RH) is
also deﬁned to be zero. ISA MSL pressure is 1013.2 hPa. Temperature is 15◦ C and
the density is 1.225 kg/m3 . The ISA lapse rate deﬁnes temperature as falling at 1.98◦ C
per 1000 feet (which is a mongrel unit being part metric and part imperial). Although
the height of the tropopause is a function of latitude because the earth is rotating, ISA
deﬁnes the tropopause as 36 000 feet and above this the air temperature is −56.5◦ C. For
many purposes the approximation of −2◦ C per 1000 feet can be used as the lapse rate.
Given the above, the pressure and density of the ISA can be calculated for any height
above sea level. The density is important because it directly affects the power that can
be produced by the engine(s) and the thrust produced by the rotors.

8.4

Pressure and density altitude

Altimeters do not measure height because they are basically pressure gauges with
a creative scale. Only in ISA conditions does an altimeter measure height because the
pressure will correctly match the scale reading. In all other conditions, the altimeter
reads altitude, best deﬁned as estimated height subject to an error. If sea level pressure at

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 325 — #3

326 The Art of the Helicopter
the location in question is known, the error can be minimized by adjusting the altimeter
setting scale to that pressure. However, if instead the altimeter setting scale is set to the
ISA MSL pressure of 1013.2 hPa, the altimeter reads pressure altitude. This is deﬁned
as the altitude in the ISA at which the same pressure exists. Pressure altitude is used
primarily for ﬂight in airways where it assures vertical separation (see section 7.7).
Whereas pressure is primarily a navigational tool, density is what governs performance. Engines produce power by releasing thermal energy due to combustion of
hydrocarbon fuel in air. The mass of fuel that can be burned is directly proportional
to the mass of the air available, whereas physical limitations in the construction of the
engine set the greatest volume of air that can be drawn in. Consequently the density
has a signiﬁcant effect because it determines the mass of air per unit of volume the
engine has drawn in. Lift is obtained when the rotor imparts downward momentum to
the air. As the disc area is ﬁxed, the volume of air the rotor can inﬂuence is also ﬁxed
for a given ﬂight regime. Thus the degree to which the rotor can impart momentum is
controlled by air density.
In the ISA the density at a given height will always be the same because ISA deﬁnes
MSL pressure and temperature and speciﬁes zero humidity. Thus using the standard
ﬁgures, the pressure and temperature at any height can be deduced and the density must
follow from that. In practice, the pressure and temperature will differ from ISA and the
local density will not be ISA density. The concept of density altitude was introduced to
allow for such changes. Density altitude is the altitude in the ISA at which the density
is the same as the present density. In order to assess the performance of a machine
under real conditions, the pilot will calculate the density altitude for those conditions
and then consult the ﬂight manual where the performance is speciﬁed as a function of
density altitude.
Figure 8.1 shows a standard density/altitude chart that converts pressure altitude
entered on the diagonal lines to density altitude measured along the vertical axis. The
horizontal axis is air temperature and the single line falling to the right shows the ISA
air temperature falling with height at the standard lapse rate with pressure altitude.
Thus the chart shows that the line corresponding to zero pressure altitude crosses the
line corresponding to zero density altitude at 15◦ C (ISA MSL conditions). In order to
use the chart, the local pressure altitude is located where it crosses the ISA lapse rate
line. Reading vertically down from this pressure altitude will give the ISA temperature
for that height. If the actual temperature is the same, the pressure altitude and density
altitude are the same. However, in practice a different temperature will often be found.
If the diagonal line sloping from bottom left to top right and corresponding to the
pressure altitude is followed until it intersects a vertical line drawn up from the actual
temperature, the vertical position of the intersection determines the density altitude.
The ﬁgure shows an example. In some ﬂight manuals, the conversion to density altitude
may be incorporated in certain performance charts. An example will be given in the
next section.
The effect of humidity is not generally considered in density altitude charts, but a rule
of thumb used by pilots is to add 1000 feet to the density altitude if the humidity is
high. Typically helicopters have no means to measure humidity and the pilot’s estimate
has to be used.

8.5

Power management

Helicopter operation is largely concerned with power management. The power plant
supplies power and the airframe demands power. Both supply and demand are

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 326 — #4

Helicopter performance 327

corrects for ISA standard lapse rate and allows compensation for non-ISA temperature. See text.

subject to considerable variations. Sustained ﬂight is not possible where demand
exceeds available power. In the opposite case, ﬂight in equilibrium is possible with
a power surplus, usually called a power margin, which can be used for climbing or for
manoeuvres.
In general the engine(s) provide power which has a physical limit to the transmission
which has a physical torque limit. For a constant RPM machine such as a helicopter
rotor, power is proportional to torque and engines may be described in terms of torque
available. The engine power/torque available will be a function of density altitude. The
rate at which fuel can be burned is limited primarily by the temperature that the power
turbine blades can withstand. At low altitude, the compressor can produce plenty of
mass ﬂow and the combustion takes place with excess air that limits the power turbine
temperature. As altitude increases the air density falls and the mass ﬂow reduces. At
some point the amount of fuel burned must be reduced to prevent excessive turbine

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 327 — #5

328 The Art of the Helicopter
temperature. From then on available power must fall. However, the fall in power is not
as steep as might be expected because intake air temperature falls with altitude and
this offsets the loss of density due to reduced pressure to some extent. As a result the
engine power/torque available curve may show the characteristic knee of Figure 8.2.
At low density altitudes the torque must be kept within the constant transmission limit
whereas above a certain density altitude the available torque falls.
The rotors in turn require power that is a complex function of density altitude and
airspeed. The power will be delivered to the main and tail rotors and will be absorbed
by various forms of drag. Power required to hover is clearly important and the worst
case will be at zero airspeed. Figure 8.3 shows a typical chart relating hover power

Fig. 8.2 Power available may be constant at low altitude owing to a transmission limit until turbine temperature
limits dominate at higher density altitude.

to skid height for ﬁxed density altitude. Above about one rotor diameter the power
becomes constant and the machine is considered to be out of ground effect (OGE).
In the ﬂight manual, a chart similar to that shown in Figure 8.4 may be given. This
allows hover performance to be predicted for any combination of all-up weight (AUW)

330 The Art of the Helicopter
and density altitude. The top right section of the chart allows density altitude to be
computed by ﬁnding a point where a horizontal line from pressure altitude on the left
scale intersects the free air temperature line. A vertical line from this point will give
a reading on the density altitude scale. This line will also intersect the AUW curve on
the bottom right chart. Moving left from this point will give a reading on the hover
OGE torque scale.
The bottom left chart converts the hover OGE torque to the torque needed at various
skid/wheel heights. The HOGE line is at an angle of 45◦ and does not change the torque
required. However, the lines for various heights of IGE have different slopes and reduce
the torque accordingly.
The chart can be used in different ways. In the above example the pressure altitude,
air temperature and AUW were used to ﬁnd the torque needed to hover. However, from
AUW and known altitude of the destination it is possible to deduce the maximum air
temperature at which a vertical landing could be made. In the case of an engine failure,
the chart can also be used to show that above a certain AUW hovering even in ground
effect is impossible and a rolling landing on a runway would be needed.
In practice, power needed to hover is affected by windspeed. In most cases the power
needed will be reduced, except if the wind is from a particular direction and at a particular speed that causes the main and tail rotors to rob one another of inﬂow. This
phenomenon was considered in Chapter 5. The tandem rotor helicopter is less sensitive
to wind direction in the hover.
Turning next to forward ﬂight, Figure 8.5(a) shows how the various power requirements typically change with airspeed. The rotors will require induced power and proﬁle
power and the hull will require parasitic power to overcome drag. The induced power
will be high in the hover and falls as airspeed increases. This is because forward ﬂight
gives the rotor access to a larger mass of air per unit time and production of thrust
becomes more efﬁcient. The induced power will also increase with AUW. Proﬁle power
will also rise with AUW and increases slightly with airspeed as the proﬁle drag on
the advancing blade increases more than the drag on the retreating blade lessens.
In contrast, the parasite power is substantially independent of AUW, but increases
with airspeed. The drag force will increase as the square of airspeed, but the power is
the product of the drag force and the airspeed and so will increase as the cube of the
airspeed. At very high speeds the rotor disc must be inclined forwards substantially so
that the horizontal component of thrust from the rotor can become large to overcome
hull drag. This nose-down attitude may make the hull drag even greater. As main rotor
thrust increases the tail rotor thrust will also need to increase to counteract torque and
so the tail power will also increase at high speeds.
Figure 8.5(b) shows that there is an airspeed, typically around 50 knots, at which
the total power is minimum. At this airspeed the induced power has fallen but the
parasite power has not yet risen seriously. The ﬁgure also shows the available power,
which is relatively constant, although in some machines it rises with airspeed owing
to the ram effect of dynamic pressure at the intake. The power required reaches the
available power on the right and this would determine the highest airspeed that could
be reached, assuming no structural limits or retreating blade stall effects. At all lower
airspeeds, a power margin exists and so the machine can take off vertically. At the
minimum power airspeed the machine can stay airborne for the longest time. Clearly
the greatest power margin exists at this airspeed and thus the maximum rate of climb
would be obtained at full power. The minimum rate of descent in autorotation will also
be obtained at this airspeed.
Figure 8.5(b) contrasts the conditions for a normally loaded machine at sea level,
with the conditions for a high AUW, where the available power only exceeds the required

power over a range of airspeeds and the conditions for a high density altitude where
the available power has fallen. Once more level ﬂight is only possible over a range of
airspeeds.

8.6

Flying for maximum range

The airspeed that will yield the greatest range is not obvious. The problem can be
approached by considering that greater distance can be ﬂown at higher speed, provided
it does not require disproportionately more power. The key here is the proportionality.
If an increase in airspeed of, say, 5% needs a power increase of 4%, then obviously it
is worth going faster, whereas if a speed increase of 5% requires a power increase of
6% the range will fall. Consequently an approximation to the best range in still air is

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 331 — #9

332 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 8.6 Maximum range speed. In still air this is found by a line from the origin tangent to the power curve.
In the case of wind the origin is offset by the windspeed.

obtained by ﬁnding the airspeed at which the rate of power increase is exactly equal to
the rate of airspeed increase. Figure 8.6 shows that this speed can be found graphically
where a line from the origin is tangential to the power curve. The presence of wind
changes the situation. In this case it is necessary to ﬁnd the airspeed at which the rate
of power increase is exactly the same as the rate of groundspeed increase. Figure 8.6
shows that this can be found graphically by offsetting the origin by an amount given by
the component of wind velocity in the direction of ﬂight. For a headwind, the maximum
range speed will be faster than that needed for still air.
There is a further complication in practice, because a real engine does not consume
fuel proportionally to power produced. This is particularly true of turbine engines that
sustain a loss of efﬁciency due to driving the compressor. This loss becomes a smaller
proportion of total power as power produced increases and so it is a characteristic
of a turbine that efﬁciency increases with power. Consequently the best range speed
according to Figure 8.6 is not strictly correct for a turbine helicopter. To be precise, the
machine should be ﬂown at the airspeed where the rate of fuel consumption increase is
exactly the same as the rate of groundspeed increase. Figure 8.7 shows fuel consumption
against power normalized at minimum power speed. At (a) is the curve for a turbine
helicopter. This has the same trend as the power curve that is also shown, but does
not rise as steeply above minimum power speed because the engine is being used more
efﬁciently. It will be seen that the airspeed for the best range is somewhat higher than
the ﬁgure obtained in Figure 8.6. In practice the power curve, or the fuel consumption
curve, remains close to the line from the origin over a range of airspeeds so it is not
necessary to be rigid about the airspeed as the loss of range due to a moderate departure
from the ideal is not serious. In practice the actual airspeed can usefully be faster than
the theoretical maximum range speed by an amount that increases fuel ﬂow by 1%.
This gives a useful reduction in journey time with a negligible range penalty.

Helicopter performance 333

Fig. 8.7 Fuel ﬂow for a turbine helicopter (a) and gasoline powered helicopter (b) superimposed on power
required. Note these are not the same as the efﬁciencies of the two types of engine change differently with
load. The turbine is inefﬁcient at low power and most efﬁcient at full power. The piston engine is most efﬁcient
at less than full power.

Gasoline-engine helicopters behave differently. At high power, the mixture may have
to be rich so that some additional cooling is provided by fuel evaporation and this
reduces efﬁciency. In cruise, the mixture can be leaned out to make the engine more
efﬁcient and improve range. Thus a gasoline engine may be most efﬁcient at some
fraction of full power rather than at full power as is the case for the turbine. As a result
the fuel consumption curve rises more steeply than the power curve away from minimum
power speed as shown in Figure 8.7(b). Thus the spread of speeds for maximum range
with a piston engine will be smaller than for a turbine. The gasoline engine does not
run on excess air and so available power will fall off rapidly with altitude. However,
if a turbocharger is ﬁtted, engine power can be maintained at altitudes sufﬁcient to
reduce parasite drag.
Where the utmost range is to be achieved, ﬂying at an appropriate altitude may be
useful. There are two related factors to consider. The ﬁrst is that all real helicopters
need an available load factor signiﬁcantly above unity so they can manoeuvre safely.
The greatest efﬁciency is obtained by running the rotor blades at a CL of around
0.5, suggesting that the available ISA MSL load factor of a typical helicopter will be
around 2. By deﬁnition cruise takes place at unity load factor where the lift to drag
ratio changes little with CL . The second is that helicopters need engines whose power
is appropriate for the load factor and in cruise these will be running inefﬁciently at part
power. For the best range anything that reduces the load factor and improves engine
efﬁciency should be considered. Reducing the air density may do both. In the case
of a rotor running at constant RRPM, reduced air density will mean that a greater
angle of attack is needed. However, if this changes CL from 0.5 to 0.6, the increases in
induced drag and proﬁle drag will be minor. However, there is a signiﬁcant reduction
in parasite drag.
A turbine engine has no actual throttle and so operates with excess air, like a Diesel
engine. Unlike a Diesel engine, the compressor suffers proﬁle drag. An efﬁcient way of
throttling a turbine engine back to cruise power is to reduce the density of the inlet air.

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 333 — #11

334 The Art of the Helicopter
In a gasoline engine there is a throttle that forcibly limits the mass ﬂow through the
engine and reduces the inlet manifold pressure. The reduced manifold pressure opposes
the motion of the piston on the induction stroke and causes pumping loss. Pumping
loss can be reduced by supplying air with lower density and opening the throttle to
compensate. Consequently ﬂying at an appropriate altitude reduces the total power
needed and makes both gasoline and turbine engines more efﬁcient. In a gasoline
engine there is another option available to increase efﬁciency, which is to use heated
induction air. This is normally provided to prevent icing in humid conditions, but hot
air is less dense than cold air and so throttles the engine back to cruise power with less
pumping loss thereby increasing efﬁciency and range.
Figure 8.8(a) shows the fuel ﬂow curves for a CH-47D at two AUWs at sea level
and +10◦ C. Figure 8.8(b) shows the corresponding curves for the same AUWs but at
10 000 feet pressure altitude and the air temperature 20◦ C lower to allow for the lapse
rate. It will be clear that the fuel ﬂow is signiﬁcantly reduced for the lower AUW by
climbing to the higher altitude as the reduction in parasite power exceeds the increase in
proﬁle and induced power. For the higher AUW, CL becomes too large and the increase
in induced and proﬁle power outweighs the reduction of parasite power and fuel ﬂow
is higher.
If altitude is taken to extremes, it would depend on the design of the machine and
the AUW whether the engine ran out of power before the rotor stalls or vice versa. In
practice a somewhat lower altitude can be found at which a signiﬁcant improvement in
range can be had. On a long ferry ﬂight with auxiliary tanks, the weight of the machine
reduces signiﬁcantly as fuel burns off and the optimum altitude will increase. The best
range will be obtained by adhering to a calculated altitude proﬁle throughout the ﬂight.
It should be noted that at very high altitudes, reduced air density results in reduced
cyclic authority.

8.7

Climbing and descending

At airspeeds above 30 knots or so, the parasite power and the proﬁle power and induced
power of the rotors are affected only slightly by a change of disc inclination due to climb
or descent. Hull drag will change slightly. Consequently it is reasonable to assume that
any power margin in Figure 8.5 is available for climbing. Figure 8.9 shows a graph of
power margin against airspeed. Effectively the upper curve is the difference between
available power and power needed at constant altitude as a function of airspeed. By
subtracting the available power from this curve, a lower, zero-power curve is obtained.
The curves must terminate on the right at Vne and as a result the region in which ﬂight
is possible is bounded by the two curves. The upper curve shows the rate of climb
available if the entire power margin is converted into potential energy. The lower curve
shows the rates of descent possible in autorotation.
Figure 8.9 shows the best rate of descent without power is at the same speed as the
best rate of climb with power. However, in the case of power loss the goal is to reach
a safe landing area rather than to descend at the minimum rate. There will be more
possibilities if the machine is autorotated at the airspeed that gives maximum range.
That airspeed is also derived in Figure 8.9. As before, the origin needs to be offset
for head or tail winds. In autorotation the power comes from the release of potential
energy as the machine descends. In theory, the heavier the machine, the more power
is liberated, so it should be able to ﬂy further. Under certain circumstances this will
be observed. Where an emergency dictates maximum range in autorotation, the pilot

ceiling there is only one airspeed available.

can increase rotor efﬁciency by reducing RRPM. This will reduce proﬁle drag and
require a larger angle of attack so that the lift to drag ratio will improve. Whilst very
low RRPM is dangerous because it may not be possible to recover, a reduction of 10%
is quite safe and has a dramatic effect on autorotation range. Prior to landing RRPM
can be recovered by gradual application of back cyclic. In some machines the use of
low RRPM may result in increased vibration if the rotor detuning has been optimized
for a narrow RRPM range.
Figure 8.9 applies at one density altitude only and obviously climb or descent will
change that. Figure 8.10 shows an alternative way of depicting the performance. This is
a chart of minimum and maximum airspeed as a function of density altitude. Minimum
power and maximum range speeds may also be shown as a function of density altitude.
At sea level minimum airspeed is zero showing that vertical climb is possible. At some
density altitude the HOGE power will exceed available power and then the minimum
speed becomes non-zero. At sea level the maximum airspeed is power limited but may
peak at some density altitude where reduced air density is reducing proﬁle drag and
improving rotor L/D. At higher density altitude maximum airspeed will fall again. As
density altitude increases, the available power falls down into the power-required curve
and the differences between minimum power speed, minimum airspeed and maximum
airspeed become smaller. Where these speeds coincide, the absolute ceiling has been
reached. As the absolute ceiling can only be reached asymptotically, the service ceiling
is often taken to be a slightly lower density altitude at which a rate of climb of 100 fpm
remains.
Given the existence of a minimum airspeed, potentially a helicopter could take off
vertically at sea level with a full load and ﬂy to some high altitude destination at best
rate of climb speed where an attempted vertical landing would result in a crash. The
fact that this does not happen in practice is due to a combination of the availability
of power curves in the ﬂight manual and piloting techniques that establish what the
power margin is before attempting a landing.

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 336 — #14

Helicopter performance 337

In the case of a light piston-engine helicopter, the payload is small and the altitude
performance modest. The ﬂight manual may be quite sparse in the power curve department and safety is primarily assured by piloting technique. In the case of a heavy
military transport helicopter, the payload may exceed the empty weight of the machine
and ﬂight in a wide combination of AUWs and density altitudes is possible. The
ﬂight manual may contain many pages of fuel ﬂow curves for various AUWs, pressure altitudes and air temperatures. In the case of the CH-47D there are over 100 such
curves.
When plenty of power is available, the steepest climb will be vertical. However,
under certain combinations of payload and density altitude, vertical climb may not
be possible. In this case obstacle clearance becomes an issue and ﬁnding the airspeed at which the steepest climb can be obtained is important. Even if there is
a power margin, knowing the speed at which the steepest climb occurs is useful. The
climb gradient is the ratio of climb speed to forward airspeed. Finding the optimum
airspeed requires ﬁnding a point on the power curve where the surplus power is proportional to airspeed. Figure 8.6 shows that this can be done graphically by ﬁnding
the point on the power curve where a line from the available power at zero airspeed is
tangent.
In most cases the steepest climb performance will be required for obstacle clearance
on take-off where there is insufﬁcient power margin for HOGE. In this case the correct
procedure is to make a running take-off by accelerating as hard as possible in ground
effect and making no attempt to gain height until the best climb gradient airspeed is
obtained. At this airspeed the attitude of the machine is adjusted so that no further
increase in airspeed occurs. The machine will then climb at constant airspeed so that
power margin goes entirely towards climbing. The ﬂight manual may contain charts
that allow obstacle clearance ability to be predicted for various AUWs and density
altitudes.

8.8

Power management in multiple-engine
machines

It is not generally the case that multiple engines are ﬁtted to obtain more power. Turboshaft engines are available with phenomenal power output and a single engine could
lift any but the most extreme helicopter. Instead the goal of multiple engines is to
provide some degree of resilience to engine failure. In the case of passenger carrying
civil helicopters, multiple engines and suitable operational procedures together allow
safe ﬂight to be maintained in the case of a single engine failure at any time. In such
cases a landing would be made as soon as practicable after the failure. In military
machines, engine failure may result from hostile acts and has to be considered more
probable than natural failure. Frequently it will be a goal that the mission shall be
completed despite the loss of one engine. A prompt landing is not viable if the machine
is over enemy territory or water and ﬂight may have to be sustained.
Turbine engines are light in weight for the power they produce, so there is no technical
difﬁculty in providing further engines, although this will reﬂect in purchase and running
costs. If the remaining engine(s) is to be able to provide enough power for ﬂight should
one fail, then clearly under normal conditions all engines will be operating at a fraction
of their maximum power and will be relatively inefﬁcient because of the proﬁle drag in
the compressors. Turbine engines are very reliable and failures are relatively uncommon.
Consequently instead of providing excessive continuous power, it is more sensible to
design engines that can be overrated for short periods of time. The continuous power

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 337 — #15

338 The Art of the Helicopter
rating of an engine is based largely on the temperature and rotational forces the blades
at the hot end can withstand between overhauls. The oil-and air-cooling system will be
designed to cope with these conditions. If these conditions are exceeded, the blade life
will be reduced as higher than normal temperatures would increase the rate at which the
blades creep or extend. The oil temperature may also rise. However, such conditions
can be tolerated for a short time and an engine can be given a higher ‘contingency’
rating which it could only reliably tolerate for a few minutes. There may also be an
even higher emergency rating that might only be sustainable for half a minute. If an
engine failure is experienced during a critical phase of ﬂight, the remaining engine
would exceed its normal operating limits by entering contingency power to make up
a good deal of the power lost.
If an engine enters one of these conditions, an indicator that can only be reset on the
ground operates and a timer runs to measure the degree of overload. The use of these
contingency power ratings in some cases may put the engine under such stress that it
will need immediate and substantial parts replacement, particularly in the area of the
blades at the hot end, but the frequency with which this happens is so low that the
saving in fuel when the engines are working normally is of more consequence.
As machines have multiple engines for safety, it should be clear that adequate power
should be available with one engine failed. With all engines running, more power is
available than is needed. In this case the machine is ﬂown normally by remaining
within the transmission torque limits, whereas in the case of an engine failure the
machine is ﬂown within the ratings of the remaining engines. Figure 8.11 shows the
example of a twin-engine machine in which the remaining engine will provide 140%

Fig. 8.11 One engine inoperative (OEI) conditions. If the remaining engine can provide 70% of transmission
limit, with low AUW, nearly all of the ﬂight envelope is available at contingency power, and a useful cruise
envelope is available at non-contingency, or 50% of transmission limit. Such a machine could ﬂy a long way
after a failure. At high AUW, the machine can only stay airborne using contingency power, so it has to land
before the time limit expires.

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 338 — #16

Helicopter performance 339

of its continuous torque rating during contingency. This means that the helicopter has
70% of its usual torque available to deal with the failure and for landing. In the case
of a heavily loaded helicopter, 70% of torque may not be enough under some conditions and as a result the helicopter will have a form of avoid curve with one engine
inoperative within which it cannot maintain height. This condition can be dealt with
by appropriate piloting. Pilots of twin-engine machines prefer to stay out of the OEI
avoid region so that an unexpected engine failure can be dealt with readily.

8.9

The ﬂight manual

Elementary safety considerations suggest that the operation of aircraft must be subject
to regulations and procedures many of which are ultimately part of the law of the
land. The ﬂight manual forms part of that framework as in most countries it is a legal
requirement to carry the ﬂight manual in the aircraft to which it relates. All qualiﬁed
pilots are aware of the general procedures and regulations regarding aviation, but the
ﬂight manual lists those facts speciﬁc to a certain model of aircraft.
Neglecting prototypes and experimental machines, aircraft in general operation must
be certiﬁed. This means that, independently of the designer and manufacturer, the relevant authorities have examined the design of the machine and carried out ﬂight tests.
The examination is intended to ensure that all relevant regulations regarding the construction have been met and that as far as reasonably possible any areas of weakness
or mechanical unreliability have been eliminated. The ﬂight tests are intended to show
that the aircraft has no handling peculiarities that might be beyond the skill of the
average pilot and to establish the limitations of ﬂight conditions. The compilation of
the ﬂight manual and the accuracy of its contents will thus be seen to be part of the
certiﬁcation process.
Part of the ﬂight manual is known as the approved section. This part contains the
information that is mandatory for safe operation. It will contain a table of contents
and a mechanism for logging the incorporation of any subsequent updated or amended
sections so that it can readily be established that the manual is complete and up to date.
The approved section contains four basic types of information: limitations, normal
procedures, emergency procedures and performance data.
Limitations set out in the ﬂight manual are intended to prevent the machine being
ﬂown in inappropriate circumstances, or, when it is ﬂown, to prevent it being subject
to excessive stresses. Many helicopters are not certiﬁed for ﬂight in icing conditions.
Many are not certiﬁed for IFR. Some can only safely be operated with a pilot and
a co-pilot. Few are certiﬁed for aerobatics.
Vne (airspeed not to be exceeded) primarily protects the blades and will often be
speciﬁed as a function of altitude. The torque limit primarily protects the transmission. Turbine temperature limits protect the engine. The AUW of the machine must
not exceed the ﬁgure in the ﬂight manual. All-up weight can remain the same if the
relative proportions of fuel and payload are changed. The distribution of weight is very
important in a helicopter having a single main rotor. If the CM is some distance from
the rotor shaft, cyclic control authority may be diminished in some directions and large
alternating stresses are set up in the rotor. Figure 8.12(a) shows that the CM must be
maintained within a conical region surrounding the shaft axis. In the case of a teetering
rotor head, the apex of the cone coincides with the teetering bearing. In rotor heads with
inbuilt ﬂapping stiffness, the apex of the cone (b) will be above the rotor. Figure 8.12(c)
shows that in a tandem rotor helicopter the fore-and-aft CM position must lie between
two vertical limit lines. However, the position of these lines is a function of AUW.

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 339 — #17

340 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 8.12 (a) Allowed locations for CM with zero-offset head lie in a cone below the rotor head. Distance
behind the rotor may be less than in front. (b) Cone apex is higher with offset or hingeless head. (c) Tandem
rotor CM limits lie between two vertical lines which move closer as AUW increases.

When lightly loaded, the CM of a tandem is subject to remarkable freedom, but as
AUW approaches the maximum value the CM position is more constrained to prevent
an excessive load being carried by one rotor. Note that a tandem rotor helicopter will
also have lateral CM position limits and heavy payloads must be positioned on the
hull centreline. In general the certiﬁcation authorities are not concerned with how the
position of the CM is to be calculated, only where it is. The manufacturer’s data will
usually contain details on how the CM position is established.
In helicopters having zero-offset rotor heads, further limitations may be applied. The
carrying of loads attached to the skids may be prohibited. There may also be a section
describing the consequences of low-g or pushover manoeuvres designed to avoid mast
bumping or boom strikes that are a characteristic hazard with this class of machine.
A windspeed limit for rotor starting may be found. Above that limit, blade sailing
may be excessive, leading to droop stop pounding, blade damage or boom strikes.
In addition to the approved section, the ﬂight manual will also contain a section
provided by the manufacturer to assist in the operation of the helicopter. Civil ﬂight
manuals tend to be relatively sparse because aviation manufacturers have become
targets for litigation in recent years. In contrast military ﬂight manuals can be exceedingly comprehensive, particularly in areas such as fuel ﬂow with respect to AUW and
density altitude so that the best performance can be obtained from the machine.

8.10

Stability

An unconditionally stable aircraft is one that, if disturbed from trimmed ﬂight, can be
placed in any attitude and then, if the controls are released, it will return to straight and
level ﬂight on its own. The ability to return to straight and level ﬂight is known as static
stability, whereas dynamic stability is concerned with the manner, or promptness, with
which the return occurs. Free ﬂying model aeroplanes and some full-size aeroplanes are
unconditionally stable. In forward ﬂight on the upward part of the power curve, many
helicopters are stable because the tail rotor acts like a ﬁn and the tail surfaces have
sufﬁcient pitch authority. However, as the goal of the helicopter is to hover, a great deal
of ﬂying will take place on the back of the power curve where stability is impossible to
achieve without pilot intervention or some artiﬁcial mechanism. Thus to be fair, it is not
that helicopters are fundamentally less stable than aeroplanes, more that helicopters
can explore ﬂight regimes that are not available to aeroplanes in which control is simply
harder.
Stability is a topic where there may be conﬂict between performance and safety and
between complexity and economy. It is important to consider the entire system in
order to form a balanced view. The airframe itself will have certain stability behaviour,
but this will be modiﬁed by the actions of the pilot. Technically a helicopter airframe
may be unstable, but piloting these unstable devices gives many of us a great deal of
pleasure. This is because the actions of the pilot turn the unstable airframe into a stable
system. In fact the unstable airframe with an intelligent pilot and/or control system
forms the most manoeuvrable combination because it is axiomatic that the more stable
the airframe is made, the less willing it is to deviate from its course.
Pilots very quickly become instinctive and ﬂy at constant altitude with correct RRPM
and no slip without conscious thought. It doesn’t make much difference to the pilot if
the machine deviates from his intended course because of a gust or because it is has
a degree of instability. The result is the same; he operates the controls to bring it back on
course. In good conditions, the pilot has so little difﬁculty in doing this that he can ﬂy
a machine with signiﬁcant stability problems without necessarily realizing. However, if
visibility becomes poor so that the horizon is obscured, the pilot’s instinctive ability to
stabilize the machine is impaired. Now the machine that is fun to ﬂy VFR because it is so
manoeuvrable becomes a menace in IFR because the workload involved in interpreting
the artiﬁcial horizon and other instruments to make constant course corrections may
be too great.
Today most helicopters are designed on the assumption that they will be used in
IFR, but this has not always been the case. In practice machines certiﬁed for VFR only
may have subsequently undergone a number of modiﬁcations in order to obtain IFR
certiﬁcation. These modiﬁcations frequently involve stability and pilot workload. In
some cases modiﬁcations to stability can mean that a machine formerly requiring two
pilots for IFR can then be certiﬁed for single pilot IFR ﬂight.
The stability of the airframe can also be augmented artiﬁcially. Several of these
techniques were shown in Chapter 7. In principle an unstable airframe with an
artiﬁcial stability system gives the best of both worlds because the pilot can retain
the manoeuvrability of the unstable airframe whilst enjoying the artiﬁcial stability. In
practice some thought has to be given to what will happen if the artiﬁcial stability
system fails in IFR. Either the artiﬁcial system has to be made redundant so that
it continues to function in the presence of a failure or the airframe has to be made
sufﬁciently stable that pilot workload remains reasonable if the augmentation system fails. Aerodynamic stability improvements are very reliable because they usually

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 341 — #19

342 The Art of the Helicopter
involve the addition of passive structures or changes to the shape of the existing
structure.
Stability in helicopters is a complex issue in comparison to aeroplanes because helicopters are more asymmetrical, have more coupling between their degrees of freedom
and greater structural elasticity owing to the use of hinges and/or ﬂexible blades. The
inherent ﬂexibility between the rotor and the hull is responsible for many peculiarities
of helicopter behaviour. In many cases the rotor tries to do one thing and the hull tries
to do the opposite and it is unclear which one will dominate. It also follows from this
that the stability characteristics of helicopters having zero-offset rotor heads will differ
from those having real or effective offset.
In all aircraft, stability can be subdivided into speciﬁc areas. Speed stability is the
ability of an aircraft to return to trimmed airspeed after a disturbance. Pitch stability
is the ability to return to the correct pitch attitude after a disturbance. Directional
stability is the ability to keep the nose at the front and lateral stability is the ability to
return the wings/rotor to a level attitude after a disturbance. If all of these are acceptable the machine may still have a problem due to the interaction of the lateral and
directional stability mechanisms. This is known as spiral stability. Helicopters may
further be assessed by their stability in the hover.
Speed stability of a main rotor is extremely good owing to the phenomenon of ﬂapback described in Chapter 3. If forward speed increases for any reason, the asymmetry
of lift between the advancing and retreating blades results in a rolling couple which
the main rotor will precess into rearward pitch. This tilts back the rotor thrust vector
tending to reduce the airspeed. Thus the rotor itself has good speed stability. However, the hull is suspended below the rotor and the hull drag effectively acts at some
distance below the rotor head, causing a downward pitching moment on the hull. Thus
an increase in airspeed causes the hull to pitch down. Depending on the type of rotor
head, this downward pitching moment will result in different hull attitude changes.
As the swashplate is controlled from the hull, hull pitchdown will cause the rotor to
pitch down.
Thus the helicopter itself may not display speed stability if the effect of the hull
dominates the effect of the rotor. In practice the helicopter may need a tail plane to
provide speed stability. If set at a suitable negative angle of incidence, the tail plane
produces a downthrust that increases with airspeed and compensates for the hull drag.
In practice the rotor on its own has excess speed stability and large amounts of
forward cyclic would be needed to increase speed. Thus some of the pitchdown due to
hull drag can be used beneﬁcially to reduce the cyclic travel needed. The tail plane area
and incidence can be selected in such a way that the speed stability is just on the positive
side of neutral. This means that airspeed increases will always result in the cyclic stick
being trimmed forwards.
If the helicopter is disturbed on its pitch axis in forward ﬂight, the RAF seen by the
blades will change, but the advancing and retreating blades will see different changes. If
a nose-up pitch disturbance is experienced, Figure 8.13 shows that the angle of attack
of both blades will increase, but the increase seen by the advancing blade is greater.
This produces a rolling couple to the retreating side that is precessed into a further
nose-up pitching moment by the gyroscopic action of the rotor. Thus it will be seen
that a rotor in forward ﬂight is unstable in pitch. This is a further reason for the use of
a tail plane in the helicopter. Dynamic stability here can be good because the tail plane
has aerodynamic damping.
With a zero-offset rotor head, any tilt of the rotor disc in pitch is opposed because
no couples are passed across the head and the hull and the swashplate attitude are little
changed. If the rotor disc pitches but the swashplate doesn’t there will be an application

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 342 — #20

Helicopter performance 343

of cyclic pitch opposing the pitching. In the case of a hingeless rotor head, couples can
be passed across the rotor head and these can cause the hull to follow the rotor. Thus
a helicopter with a hingeless rotor head will tend to be less stable in pitch. We expect
that because such rotor heads offer greater manoeuvrability.
Helicopters with a conventional tail rotor have good directional stability. As was seen
in Chapter 5, the tail rotor acts like a ﬁn and has good yaw damping.
In aeroplanes, lateral stability is obtained by the use of dihedral or sweepback. If
the aeroplane is rolled by a disturbance, it will slip in the direction of the roll and
the relative airﬂow will have a sideways component. In the case of dihedral, the wing
on the low side will see an increased angle of attack whereas the other wing will see
a reduced angle of attack resulting in a righting couple. In the case of sweepback, the
aspect ratio of the wing on the low side will improve and that of the other wing will
worsen, achieving the same result.
The mechanism in the helicopter is quite different. To ﬁnd out what happens it is
necessary to consider all moments acting about the roll axis which passes through the
CM. In fact moments may be analysed about any axis, including one passing through
the rotor head as Figure 8.14 shows. Essentially if a helicopter is disturbed in its roll
axis it will slip and the main rotor will see a lateral component of airspeed. This results
in sideﬂap that tends to oppose the roll and return the helicopter to a level attitude.
Thus the rotor alone acts as if it had dihedral. However, the hull is suspended below
the rotor and the displaced CM acts like a pendulum to create a righting moment. In
addition, the lateral component of airspeed will cause a side thrust that tilts the hull
in the same direction as the roll. Figure 8.14 shows that although the rotor is laterally
stable, the hull is aerodynamically unstable. The outcome depends upon the vertical
position of the CM, the aerodynamics of the hull and on the type of rotor head, but
in most cases the stability of the rotor dominates and helicopters tend to be highly
stable, possibly too stable, in roll. Dynamic stability is good because the rotor attitude
has aerodynamic damping. The zero-offset rotor head is the least stable because there

344 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 8.14 Lateral stability. In the rotor alone, lateral stability is automatic due to ﬂapback, but the hull is
unstable laterally because side slip tilts it further in the direction of roll.

Fig. 8.15 Forces acting on a helicopter that has been disturbed in roll and which is slipping. The ratio of yaw
to roll moments determines the spiral dive or Dutch roll characteristics.

is no couple from the rotor to stop the hull being rolled by lateral drag. This has the
effect of rolling the swashplate. This applies cyclic in a destabilizing sense. The hingeless
rotor is the most stable because lateral drag cannot roll the hull so readily against the
stiffness of the head. Thus lateral stability is better with the hingeless rotor: precisely
the opposite of the case for longitudinal stability.
Figure 8.15 shows that in a helicopter with slip, the sideways component of airspeed
will act on the hull, the tail rotor and on any ﬁns. The ﬁn and tail rotor are intended
to create a yawing moment that turns the machine to face the direction towards which
it is slipping. However, if the ﬁn and tail rotor have a large area and are mounted low
on the machine, the rolling moment they produce may exceed the stabilizing rolling

“helic - CHAP08” — 2003/11/22 — page 344 — #22

Helicopter performance 345

moment from the main rotor. The helicopter may enter a spiral dive if disturbed in roll.
Spiral instability may be remedied by lowering the CM, reducing ﬁn area or by moving
it upwards or forwards or by adding side area to the hull high up ahead of the mast.
Upward relocation of the tail rotor and/or increasing the main rotor ﬂapping offset
will also be beneﬁcial.
On the other hand if the ﬁn and tail rotor are high mounted, they may hardly oppose
the dihedral effect of the main rotor at all and the helicopter may have too much lateral
stability such that if disturbed it suffers a phenomenon called a dutch roll.
Dutch roll describes a ﬂight path like a corkscrew. Following a slip, excessive lateral
stability creates a restoring roll couple so powerful that there is insufﬁcient momentum
for the helicopter to overshoot the correct attitude. The helicopter then oscillates about
its path near-sinusoidally in pitch, roll and yaw but with phase differences between the
motions. The motion may be damped heavily, so that it dies out or it may stabilize with
certain amplitude. In some cases the amplitude will grow indeﬁnitely. In most cases
pilot intervention prevents such a divergence. However, for IFR operation, Dutch roll
is considered as detrimental as spiral instability. Dutch roll may be remedied by raising
the CM, by lowering the tail rotor, by reducing the main rotor ﬂapping offset, by
increasing ﬁn area, by moving the ﬁn back and/or down or by adding side area to the
hull low down. Fences may be seen on the bottom of the hull for this purpose.
Hover stability is marginal in most helicopters because the hull mass is located
below the rotor. It might be thought that this would act like a pendulum and give
stability but this is not what happens. The hull has mass and is more or less ﬂexibly
suspended from the rotor according to the type of rotor head. As a result the attitude
of the hull will always lag the attitude of the rotor. Figure 8.16 shows that if a helicopter is trimmed to stationary hover and then the controls are locked, it will begin
a divergent oscillation. The rotor on its own is stable in the hover because if it moves
in any horizontal direction, ﬂapback will tend to arrest the motion. However, it can be
seen from the ﬁgure that the hull swings from side to side under the rotor, but because
the swashplate is referenced to the hull, that swinging causes cyclic inputs. These are
not phased to damp the motion, but in fact augment the motion.

Fig. 8.16 Helicopters are unstable in hover and, without pilot intervention, will wander to and fro as
shown here.

Hover stability can be obtained by putting the hull above the rotor. This causes
enormous practical difﬁculties and it is usually better to accept the hover instability.
However, Stanley Hiller designed a number of one-man helicopters (Figure 8.17) in
which the pilot was above the shrouded rotor assembly and these were very stable.
A machine built by DeLackner had the same attributes.

Other types of rotorcraft
Although the single main rotor helicopter with a tail rotor predominates, there are many
other possibilities, sometimes more complex, which give advantages under certain
conditions that outweigh the complexity. This chapter considers those possibilities.
Some of these are ﬂawed and have not been developed, whereas some were ahead
of their time and deserve to be revisited. Some have been a success from the outset,
whereas others have required a great deal of development.

9.1

The gyroplane

The gyroplane was the ﬁrst successful type of rotary wing craft and many of the constructional techniques used in early helicopters were developed there. The rotor is not
mechanically driven in normal ﬂight but instead the machine is driven forwards by a
conventional aircraft engine and airscrew in either a tractor or pusher arrangement.
Figure 1.10 showed that the tip path axis of the gyroplane rotor is tilted aft so that there
is an upward component of the relative airﬂow along the rotor axis. Effectively the rotor
is in translational autorotation. This was sometimes called automatic gyration hence
the trade name ‘autogyro’ which Juan de la Cierva’s gyroplanes were given. The name
is now used almost interchangeably with gyroplane. The aft tilt of the rotor means
that the rotor thrust is not vertical and has an aft-facing component comparable to the
drag of a wing, and similarly comprising proﬁle drag and induced drag. At constant
airspeed in level ﬂight the thrust of the propeller is in equilibrium with the weight, hull
drag and the rotor thrust. The propeller is doing work against the induced drag of the
rotor and thus delivers power to produce lift.
Driving the rotor in this way has the advantages that there is no mechanical transmission and no torque reaction. No tail rotor is necessary. However, the gyroplane is
unable to hover because it needs constant upward inﬂow. If the airspeed is brought to
zero, the machine will descend in a vertical autorotation. The gyroplane is an STOL
aircraft that cannot stall and in the proper hands it is a very safe form of transport.
However, in the absence of a tail rotor, yaw control at very low airspeeds is generally
unsatisfactory and some accidents have occurred due to uncorrected yaw on touchdown. A generous amount of vertical tail area is required, for example the triple ﬁns
of the Air and Space Model U-18. As the rotor is driven in the same way as a wing,
it is quite common for gyroplanes to include a ﬁxed wing. This has the advantage of
improving the load factor at high speeds.
The inability of the gyroplane to hover is its greatest shortcoming. Before the helicopter was developed, the gyroplane occupied a niche in which ﬁxed-wing aircraft

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 347 — #1

348 The Art of the Helicopter
were unsuitable. Once the true helicopter was developed, the gyroplane could not compete and its market contracted dramatically. The basic problem is that the rotating
wings introduce some of the high stress, the mechanical complexity and the high maintenance regime of the helicopter, for which there is no compensating ability to hover.
In gyroplanes having pusher propellers, the visibility from the cockpit is truly excellent.
It has had some success as a recreational machine and in applications such as aerial
photography where slow stable ﬂight is an advantage, but has effectively been eclipsed
by the helicopter.
The gyroplane rotor experiences the same advancing/retreating and gyroscopic phenomena as the helicopter, in fact most of these were ﬁrst discovered in the gyroplane.
One does, however, tire of reading quite erroneous descriptions of how Juan de la
Cierva’s machines rolled over because of the lift difference between advancing and
retreating blades. It is well established that the lift difference between advancing and
retreating blades may result in a roll couple, but this is subject to the gyroscopic phase
lag of 90◦ that results in ﬂapback. Clearly the advancing/retreating asymmetry was not
the origin of de la Cierva’s difﬁculty.
Figure 9.1 shows that de la Cierva’s early machines were basically aeroplanes having
conventional aircraft controls but with a rotor added. The early rotors were hingeless
and acted like gyroscopes. The problem was simply that when the conventional elevator
was operated, a pitching moment was applied, but the rotor would precess this into a
roll. Equally the operation of the ailerons would result in a rolling moment that would
precess into a pitching motion. This was not a novel phenomenon; some World War
I aircraft having rotary engines were notoriously gyroscopic and displayed precession
whereby use of the elevator would cause an amount of yaw.

Other types of rotorcraft 349

De la Cierva’s free ﬂying models were successful but they had ﬁxed surfaces with
no controls. As a result the problem was only revealed on the full-size prototypes,
several of which were destroyed before ﬂapping hinges were adopted. Blades mounted
on ﬂapping hinges cannot transfer rotor moments to the hull. With hinges ﬁtted, the
application of the conventional elevator caused the hull correctly to pitch with respect
to the rotor. As was shown in Figure 4.22 this would cause the control axis to deviate
from the tip path axis, resulting in an application of cyclic pitch to the rotor causing it
to follow the attitude of the hull. The machine would no longer roll over when elevator
controls were applied, and it would roll when the ailerons were used.
However, even if ﬂapping hinges are ﬁtted, this is still not enough. In translational
ﬂight, a ﬂapping rotor will suffer from ﬂapback due to asymmetry of lift, and will
also suffer inﬂow and coning roll. The tip path axis will be aft of and to one side of
the hub axis. The ﬂapback is countered by propeller thrust, whereas the inﬂow and
coning roll must be countered by steady application of opposing aileron in order to
ﬂy straight. Flapping hinges alone could not and did not control inﬂow and coning
roll. De la Cierva soon discovered that the gyroplane is capable of very slow ﬂight
where conventional aircraft-type ailerons and elevators are ineffective. These were soon
abandoned in favour of the tilting hub method of cyclic control described in section 4.15.
In a ﬁxed pitch gyroplane application the tilting hub allows a fairly simple mechanical
system. The rotor shaft is gimbal mounted and the blades have ﬂapping hinges (and
thus need dragging hinges and dragging dampers). Tilting the hub is possible because
of the ﬂapping hinges and this causes a cyclic pitch application. In stable forward ﬂight
the control axis (which is the hub axis) will be forward of the tip path axis because of
ﬂapback, and to one side because of inﬂow/coning roll. In other words the hub must
be tilted with respect to the tip path axis.
The reader is cautioned that many of the popular explanations of blade ﬂapping
in gyroplanes are hopelessly ﬂawed. The most common ﬂaw is the assertion that the
ﬂapping hinges were essential to the gyroplane and by association to the helicopter. This
is nonsense and the origin of it is easy to see. Many technical treatises on the gyroplane
and the helicopter, for example the classic work of Gessow and Myers, analyse with
respect to the control axis. To enable straight and level ﬂight the control axis must
be tilted and of course all rotors, hinged or hingeless, ﬂap with respect to the control
axis. The same erroneous account is seen in any number of general readership books.
It seems that someone somewhere confused the tip path axis and the control axis and
wrote an incorrect account that subsequent authors simply repeated without question.
The cyclic control requirements of the helicopter and the gyroplane are identical. As
was seen in Chapter 4, the tilting hub with ﬂapping hinges gives exactly the same
cyclic control as a hingeless head with feathering hinges and a swashplate. Gyroplanes have been built with no ﬂapping hinges and helicopters have been built with
tilting hubs.
In early gyroplanes the blades were started by pulling a rope wound round a drum
and brought up to speed by taxiing. Later machines drove the rotor from the engine to
start it, using the ground contact to oppose torque reaction. The drive was disengaged
before ﬂight. The simple gyroplane takes off in the same way as an aircraft by accelerating along a runway, although for a much shorter distance. It can lift off as soon
as the blades are turning fast enough. Using a ﬂare, a gyroplane could lose most of its
forward speed and need only a very short landing run. This allowed it to land in places
from which it could not take off again. The solution was the so-called jump-take-off
gyroplane. This would use the engine to drive the rotor on the ground in ﬁne pitch
until its RPM was somewhat in excess of that required for ﬂight. By disconnecting the
engine from the rotor and applying a higher pitch, the machine would jump into the

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 349 — #3

350 The Art of the Helicopter
air using only stored energy in the rotor, which would sufﬁce until forward speed had
been attained.
Cierva autogyros achieved jump-start using a delta-one (see section 4.7) hinge in what
was known as an autodynamic head. The inclination of the dragging hinge pin caused
an interaction between the drag angle and the pitch angle. This kept the blades in low
pitch as they dragged back due to engine torque. As soon as the drive was disconnected
the blades would swing forwards and increase their pitch and the machine would jump
into the air.
Raoul Hafner built a jump-take-off gyroplane in which the rotor head had cyclic
control via a swashplate and a collective pitch control. The pilot could control the
jump and also set the RRPM in ﬂight. The machine could land vertically because
the pilot could lower the collective lever to speed up the rotor during the descent and
then raise it again to use the stored energy to arrest the descent just before touchdown.
Hafner’s rotor head was essentially a helicopter head. Hafner went on to design the
Bristol Sycamore, a practical and successful helicopter and the ﬁrst British rotary wing
aircraft to be given a civil Certiﬁcate of Airworthiness.
The upward inﬂow of the gyroplane suggests a rather different rotor design to that of
the helicopter. The blade twist should be reversed compared to that of the helicopter,
i.e. the root should have less pitch than the tip, although the amount of twist needed is
smaller. In practice, many gyroplanes are built with no twist at all, for economy.
The rotor of the gyroplane is not supplying propulsive thrust and so the loads on
the blades are reduced. Retreating blade stall is a much-reduced problem, especially
if a ﬁxed wing is provided, and as a result many early gyroplanes cruised at speeds
considered high even in modern helicopters, especially those having wings.
Simple gyroplanes have two-bladed underslung teetering heads. If these have ﬁxed
pitch, the two blades can be rigidly ﬁxed together and gimbal mounted. Cyclic pitch
is applied by a single rod from the swashplate. This makes for a very light machine.
However, the combination of low weight with a zero-offset rotor requires more caution
on the part of the pilot, just as it does in the helicopter.
A gyroplane with a teetering head is vulnerable to a combination of low RPM
and low g. Inexperienced pilots may try to dive like a ﬁxed-wing aircraft using forward
stick when they should descend by reducing power and applying aft stick. Forward
cyclic will reduce RRPM. The correct recovery from low RPM/low g is a very gentle
progressive application of rear cyclic. A rapid or panic application of rear cyclic at
low g means that the disc tilts back without the machine following and there may be a
blade strike. There have been some accidents because of this. In contrast a gyroplane
with a hingeless rotor could be remarkably aerobatic.

9.2

The winged helicopter

The winged helicopter is conventional except for the addition of ﬁxed wings (Figure 9.2).
When this is done, the wing produces a proportion of the lift, and so the rotor produces
less lift. However, the wing also produces drag. There will be the usual induced and
proﬁle drag as well as interference drag between the wing and the rotor.
This drag has to be balanced by thrust from the rotor. As a result the rotor tip path
axis has to tilt forward further than it would without the wing. Although the vertical
component of rotor lift is reduced, the horizontal component will be increased. The
span of a practical wing will be less than the rotor diameter and so the wing will be
less efﬁcient than the rotor. Thus the winged helicopter is unlikely to be more efﬁcient

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 350 — #4

Other types of rotorcraft 351

Fig. 9.2 A winged helicopter obtains some of its lift in ﬂight from the wing. However, in the hover, the wing
may cause a download. This Sikorsky S-67 prototype ﬂew like a ﬁghter but was not produced.

than the pure helicopter, except at moderately high speed where the induced drag of
the wing is less and the direction of the wing reaction has less rearward inclination.
The reason for ﬁtting a wing is shown in Figure 9.3. This shows how the load factor
of a rotor and a wing vary with airspeed. The wing obviously shows a square law trend
with airspeed, but the rotor does not. Although the advancing blade shows this trend,
the extra lift cannot be used because it would cause imbalance with the reduced lift
from the retreating blade.
The simple helicopter is generally implemented as a low load factor machine because
provision of a high load factor implies very poor L/D ratio in the hover. Thus if a high
load factor is required in forward ﬂight so that the helicopter can make tight banked
turns, a good solution is to add a wing, as was done in the Sikorsky S-67 and the Boeing
347, neither of which entered production.
Clearly the wing will be a drawback in the hover and climb where it will cause
a download. It is also a problem in autorotation where it will produce an upload.
Following an engine failure at high speed, the wing will carry on lifting and it will be
difﬁcult to maintain rotor speed. A winged helicopter may also be less controllable,
depending on the rotor technology. Figure 4.13 showed that a teetering head can only
produce control by directing the rotor thrust so that it no longer coincides with the
CM. If the thrust is reduced because the wing is providing some of the load, the control
power is reduced in proportion. A hingeless rotor will suffer less from this effect because
it can transfer moments to the mast.
Figure 9.4 shows the solutions Boeing tried out with the experimental 347. This was
basically a CH-47 with a stretched hull, the stretch section being ﬁtted with a wing.

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 351 — #5

352 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 9.3 The wing produces lift as the square of the airspeed whereas the rotor does not. Thus a winged
helicopter can have a higher load factor at speed.

Fig. 9.4 The wing of the Boeing 347 could be set to 85◦ to reduce download in hover and had ﬂaps to vary the
camber according to ﬂight conditions.

It was also tested with four-blade rotors. In the hover the wing could be tilted 85◦ to
reduce download. In translational ﬂight the goal of the wing was to ofﬂoad the rotors
and improve load factor. The wing had ﬂaps that could be used to adjust camber. The
outer parts of the ﬂaps could be used differentially to act as ailerons. In Figure 9.4
it will be seen that the wing incidence was programmed from airspeed and collective
pitch in such a way that the appropriate degree of rotor unloading was obtained. The
ﬂap setting was computed from the collective setting and from a g-sensor measuring
acceleration normal to the cockpit ﬂoor. In a high-g manoeuvre, such as a steep turn,

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 352 — #6

Other types of rotorcraft 353

increased rotor thrust would initiate the acceleration, but the g-sensor would add wing
camber by lowering the ﬂaps so that the wing lift would increase in proportion to
the rotor thrust. Whilst the 347 was very manoeuvrable indeed, all of the necessary
components added to the weight and complexity.
If wings are successfully to be applied to helicopters, they need to be designed in
at the outset. If the wing structure can also do duty carrying fuel and/or supporting
the undercarriage, the extra weight is reduced. Most helicopters have relatively poor
hull shapes and ﬁnish and the hull drag is high. If an improved hull design is used, in
which the usual external accessories are ﬂush mounted, and a retracting undercarriage
is employed, the drag of the hull can be reduced by an amount that makes a signiﬁcant
contribution to reducing the extra thrust needed by the wing.
In some machines the undercarriage retracts into sponsons outside the hull in order
to avoid encroachment into the hull space. Such structures may also be used for fuel.
Although not intended to be wings, it is quite common to give these an airfoil section
to obtain at least some lift in return for the drag.

9.3

The compound helicopter

The compound helicopter, or gyrodyne, is one in which the rotor does not produce any
forward thrust in cruise. Instead the thrust is provided by other means. Experiments
were performed using turbojets, but as might be expected from momentum theory,
these were a very inefﬁcient way of producing thrust at helicopter speeds. Conventional
propellers give much better results.
In gyrodynes the pitch of the thrust propeller is increased as airspeed increases so that
it continues to provide forward thrust. In cruise, the cyclic control of the main rotor is
used to trim the control axis so that there is sensibly no ﬂapping and the tip path axis
remains at right angles to the direction of ﬂight. This has a number of advantages. The
thrust required from the rotor is reduced as it is only carrying the weight of the machine
and not overcoming drag as well. This may be reduced further by the use of stub wings.
Rotor power is reduced and this reduces the weight of the transmission. However, the
main advantage is aerodynamic. As the rotor remains edge-on to the airﬂow, there is
no need to increase the blade pitch to account for inﬂow as speed rises. This minimizes
the effect of retreating blade stall and reduces vibration, allowing a higher airspeed to
be reached.
The objections to the use of a wing in an otherwise conventional helicopter mostly
disappear in the compound helicopter and are replaced by advantages. The thrust to
overcome the drag of the wing does not come from the rotor, but instead is supplied
by the propeller. The beneﬁt of a higher load factor is obtained along with potential
for higher speed. The winged helicopter has difﬁculty if the engine fails at high forward speed because the wing lift prevents the rotor obtaining upﬂow. However, in the
gyrodyne, following an engine failure at speed the propeller can be set to the windmill
brake state and used to create shaft power by slowing the machine down. This power
will maintain the rotor speed until the forward speed drops sufﬁciently to lose wing lift.
In the Fairey Gyrodyne shown in Figure 1.11 the anti-torque tail rotor is replaced by
a forward-facing variable-pitch propeller mounted on a short wing at one side of the
main rotor. In the hover the anti-torque propeller pulls forwards and the main rotor has
to be tilted backwards using the cyclic control to prevent forward drift. The Gyrodyne
captured the world speed record in 1948, but development was halted following a fatal
fatigue failure having nothing to do with the compound concept.

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 353 — #7

354 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 9.5 With a propeller a gyrodyne can change its hover attitude using cyclic to balance prop thrust.

The Gazda Helicospeeder had a tail rotor mounted on a swivel. In the hover this
would be oriented conventionally, but in forward ﬂight the pilot could turn the tail
rotor to point backwards and act as a pusher propellor. This machine still exists and
has been restored by Stanley Hiller. Sikorsky also tried a similar device, which they
called a Rotoprop, on a modiﬁed S-61.
In the Lockheed Cheyenne (Figure 1.12) a tail rotor and a rear-mounted pusher
propeller are both provided. The tail rotor is on the end of the tail plane to clear the
pusher. The propeller pitch can be controlled by a twist grip on the collective lever.
In the hover the pusher propeller is typically operated in ﬂat pitch and the tail rotor
counteracts the torque as normal. However, the pusher prop can be used as a hover
attitude control. Figure 9.5 shows that with prop thrust balanced by fore or aft cyclic
the machine can hover nose up or nose down.
Accelerating into forward ﬂight is not done using the propeller as it is far more
effective to tilt the rotor disc as per pure helicopter practice. However, as speed builds
up, the disc attitude is levelled and more power is fed to the prop. As the Cheyenne
has a hingeless rotor it can provide sufﬁcient control power even when it is off-loaded
by the wing and no other controls are necessary. The Cheyenne was probably the
highest performance helicopter ever built. It could do 215 knots in level ﬂight, turn
continuously at 60◦ bank angle, could pull 2.6 g and remain stable in negative g. The fact
that the Cheyenne didn’t enter production again had nothing to do with the compound
concept.
In the Piasecki Pathﬁnder the rear prop is mounted in a ring duct equipped with
deﬂectable vanes to provide anti-torque thrust for hovering. Whilst adequate for civil
operations it is unlikely that such an arrangement would meet military crosswind hover
requirements. The Pathﬁnder’s ring duct also has adjustable horizontal vanes. In cruise
these can be trimmed so that the hull is absolutely level for minimum drag even if the
CM is not aligned with the rotor shaft. The rotor is then providing axial thrust only
and so alternating loads on the mast are minimized.
The compound helicopter offers a tangible way of improving the performance of the
helicopter, particularly in the area of forward speed. Compound helicopters have not yet
reached the market, but this is not because of any fundamental performance problem.
If there is a rotary wing technology deserving to be revisited with modern materials

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 354 — #8

Other types of rotorcraft 355

and control systems then this is it. A tail-mounted pusher propeller for forward ﬂight
would be naturally complemented by a NOTAR system for hovering, leading to a very
clean external appearance with low drag.

9.4

The convertiplane

A convertiplane changes its operating principle according to the ﬂight regime, most
obviously between hover and cruise. The Fairey Rotodyne (Figure 1.11) is a convertiplane. This machine has two turboprop engines that in addition to driving variable
pitch propellers can also produce signiﬁcant amounts of compressed air. In the hover
the compressed air is fed along the rotor blades and fuel is burned at the tips to drive
the rotor. There is no torque reaction and yaw control is obtained using differential
propeller pitch.
The tip jet drive is inefﬁcient, but is only used for take-off and landing. Once forward
speed has been obtained, the rotor drive is switched off and the rotor is tilted back so
the machine becomes a gyroplane. The rotor is partially unloaded by the wing. Landing
is achieved by reigniting the tip jets and reverting to helicopter mode, although landing
on a runway in gyroplane mode is also possible.
The winged McDonnell XV-1 has a single piston engine driving either a propeller or
an air compressor. In order to hover the compressor output is fed along the blades to
tip jets as in the Rotodyne. No yaw control could be obtained with a single prop, and
instead a pair of small ﬁxed pitch tail rotors is installed, powered by small reversible
hydraulic motors. The XV-1 can then take off as a helicopter. In forward ﬂight the
engine power can be diverted to the prop so that the machine becomes a compound
gyroplane.
The XV-1 has a substantial wing area and full conventional aircraft controls and in
cruise these will become functional. The fore-and-aft cyclic control is then automatically adjusted to control rotor speed. This is reduced to 50% of the hover RPM, so
that the wing is carrying about 80% of the machine weight. Thus the XV-1 can ﬂy as a
helicopter, a gyroplane or an airplane.
Following the progression of unloading the rotor in forward ﬂight, the next step in
the view of some designers is to dispense with the rotor altogether. There have been
numerous proposals. A two-blade rotor is stopped transversely in ﬂight to become a
wing, a four-blade rotor becomes an X-wing, a rotor folds and retracts into the hull.
All of these proposals suffer from the same practical difﬁculty – as the rotor slows
down it loses the centrifugal stiffening effect. As has been seen earlier in this book, as
a rotor slows down it ceases to be gyroscopic and the phase lag starts to reduce from
90◦ . This causes a control problem. A more serious difﬁculty shown in Figure 9.6 is
that at some stage a near-stationary rotor blade will have signiﬁcant sweep forward and
this is an unstable condition. In conventional wings and blades ﬂutter is avoided by
bringing the mass centroid towards the leading edge. However, at low rotor speed the
reverse ﬂow region would envelop the retreating blade such that leading and trailing
edges interchange so this technique cannot be used. The blade and hub would need to
be immensely rigid in torsion and bending to survive the loads. As a result no practical
machine has emerged and it is unlikely that one will.
The only in-ﬂight rotor-folding technique that appears viable is to tilt the rotor backwards and to feather the blades. As the rotor slows down it will cone up 90◦ and
ultimately stop with the blades trailing in the slipstream. However, if the rotor is going
to be tilted, why not use it as a propeller?

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 355 — #9

356 The Art of the Helicopter

Fig. 9.6 The ﬂaw in stopped rotor proposals. As rotor speed falls, the reverse ﬂow region becomes enormous
and leading and trailing edges interchange.

Tip jet convertiplanes are interesting and educational, but are unacceptably noisy
as production items. More signiﬁcantly, developments in ﬁxed-wing STOL technology
have delivered simpler solutions in many applications. Stopping the rotor in ﬂight is
simply too difﬁcult. Consequently most of the recent progress made in convertiplanes
has been in machines that tilt the rotors in some way to become propellers creating
forward thrust. This is an elegant approach because there are no redundant propellers
in the hover and no redundant rotors in cruise.
A prop rotor or tilt rotor machine can take off like a helicopter, but by turning
the rotors about a horizontal axis forward ﬂight will be achieved. When the rotor axes
are horizontal there will be no rotor lift at all and the wing must produce 100% of the
lift. In this mode the tilt rotor is an aeroplane with large propellers. Compared to a
helicopter, drag is reduced considerably and the top speed and range are signiﬁcantly
improved. The load factor also becomes that of an airplane and so the tilt rotor should
be highly manoeuvrable.
A rotor that provides enough hover thrust will be somewhat overspeciﬁed in forward
ﬂight and will be inefﬁcient because it will work at a low L/D ratio with a high proﬁle
drag penalty. The solution currently adopted is to make the cruise more efﬁcient by
reducing the rotor size. This increases the disc loading in hover, and drives up the
downwash velocity and the power required, but this power is not used for very long. It
may be an advantage to use different RPM in the hover and in forward ﬂight. With the
rotor always in axial ﬂow, the alternating forces experienced by the helicopter blade do
not exist and the rotor does not need to be detuned against vibration. It is thus quite
easy to change the rotor RPM for cruise.
The ideal would be a variable diameter rotor and although the forces involved are
considerable this is not considered insoluble. With high disc loading and a wing, the
tilt rotor is not expected to have good autorotation performance and it would appear
inadvisable to rely on a single engine.
The Bell-Boeing Osprey (Figure 9.7) tilt rotor is a true helicopter in the hover. It has
contra-rotating rotors that have cyclic and collective pitch. There are two engines, one
in each wing tip nacelle. The entire engine and transmission tilts with the rotor. To give
protection against engine failure the two rotors are connected by a cross shaft so that

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 356 — #10

Other types of rotorcraft 357

Fig. 9.7 The Bell-Boeing Osprey tilt rotor is a true side-by-side helicopter in the hover.

either engine can drive both rotors. In the wing centre section the cross shaft drives
accessories.
In the hover, the pitch axis is controlled with fore-and-aft cyclic applied equally to
both rotors. Yaw is controlled by applying fore-and-aft cyclic in opposite directions. The
roll control requires differential collective pitch. In addition to the cyclic and collective
controls, the pilot has a control that can alter the angle of the two engine nacelles.
These are synchronized so they will always have the same angle. From the hover, thrust
is increased and the nacelles are brought down. Initially the download on the tail plane
will cause the nose to rise, but as speed builds up and the dynamic pressure on the
wing and tail increases, the machine becomes an aeroplane and responds to its control
surfaces. The cyclic control of the rotor pitch is unnecessary in forward ﬂight.
The wing forms an obstruction in the hover and in the Osprey the leading and trailing
edges will both fold to present the least area to the downwash. As the angle of relative
airﬂow seen by the wing changes, ﬁrst the leading edge and then the trailing edge will
fold back to the forward ﬂight position. A disadvantage of the tilt rotor is that in the
hover the lift is applied at the wing tips and the wing is highly stressed.
One of the enabling technologies that turned a research tool into the Osprey is an
extremely complex electronic control system that recognizes the ﬂight conditions and
automatically directs the pilot’s control movements to swashplates or control surfaces
or both as necessary. This could probably not have been implemented mechanically.
The extensive use of composites has led to an airframe light enough to allow a useful
payload.

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 357 — #11

358 The Art of the Helicopter
An alternative to the tilt rotor is the tilt wing in which the wing and rotors form a
single assembly that tilts. As the wing chord is vertical in the hover the obstruction of
the downwash will be reduced. In this attitude the wing forms a deep beam and will
naturally be very stiff. The wing needs no folding ﬂap mechanism and therefore will
be less expensive. It may be possible to use the wing ailerons as a yaw control in the
hover, leading to an approach in which the rotors have no cyclic control at all, but
become variable pitch propellers. Hover roll control is then by differential collective,
but control of the pitch axis in the hover requires an additional rotor at the tail which
is only powered for the hover. The requirement for a horizontal tail rotor somewhat
offsets the saving in complexity due to eliminating the use of cyclic pitch on the main
rotors.
Whilst such an approach may be suitable for a civil machine, it is unlikely that the more
stringent requirements of the military could be met, speciﬁcally the hover performance
in a wind where the vertical wing is a drawback. The tilt wing also requires more caution
in the transition from aircraft to helicopter mode where the prop rotor thrust and wing
angle have to be carefully adjusted as a function of the airspeed.

9.5

Multi-rotor helicopters

Multi-rotor helicopters have advantages in some niches of the market, but are signiﬁcantly less common than the conventional type partly because of the added complexity
and partly because additional skills are needed to develop them. It is often the case that
one individual has perceived a particular advantage of a conﬁguration and perfected it
for a particular niche. That niche having been ﬁlled, no other manufacturer then seeks
to compete. As a result each type of machine will be associated with a particular manufacturer. Thus the tandem is associated with Vertol/Boeing, the coaxial with Kamov
and the synchropter with Kaman.
Figure 9.8(a) shows that there are a number of possibilities with two rotors. The
rotors may or may not overlap, and they may be placed in tandem or transversely to
the direction of ﬂight. If they do not overlap, the rotors may turn in the same direction
or may contra-rotate. If the rotors turn the same way, they must be inclined away
from the vertical to counteract torque as shown in Figure 9.8(b). Nicolas Florine
successfully ﬂew a machine of this kind in Belgium in 1933 as Figure 9.9 shows. In
those days helicopter dynamics were poorly understood and Florine chose same-way
rotation because the gyroscopic stability of the rotors would not cancel. Florine used
hingeless rotors and the same-way rotation would also have minimized the stress on
the hull. Test ﬂights proved Florine right as in its day it was probably the most stable
helicopter in existence. The Cierva Air Horse shown in Figure 9.10 had three rotors
which all turned the same way. Torque cancellation was obtained using the Florine
principle.

9.6

The side-by-side conﬁguration

The side-by-side arrangement of contra-rotating rotors has some advantages in forward
ﬂight because it improves the aspect ratio of the ‘disc’ and reduces the induced power
needed. Heinrich Focke’s Fw 61 was a machine of this type and was probably the
ﬁrst helicopter in the world to progress from the ﬂying test bed into a truly ﬂyable
machine. This machine achieved a degree of notoriety in 1938 when it was extensively
demonstrated as a Nazi success symbol ﬂown by Hanna Reitsch. This should not

detract from Focke’s technical achievement. The Fw-61 used the hull of a Focke-Wulf
ﬁxed-wing plane, with a forward-mounted radial engine carrying a small airscrew for
cooling. Behind the engine was a gearbox that routed power out to each rotor along
slim drive shafts.
Focke’s next machine was the Fa 223 which ﬁrst ﬂew in 1940 and reached production
in 1942. By this time Focke had left Focke-Wulf and formed a company with Gerd
Achgelis, hence the designation Fa. This was a large side-by-side machine powered
by a centrally mounted 1000 hp radial engine. With 12 metre diameter rotors it had a
payload of 2000 kg, meaning that it could almost have lifted its Sikorsky contemporary.
The Fa 223 reached 7500 metres, ﬂew at 200 kph and was a great technical success,
although few orders were fulﬁlled because of bombing raids on the factories. After the

war the Fa 223 became the ﬁrst helicopter to ﬂy the English channel when the RAF
recovered a captured machine (Figure 9.11).
The largest helicopter in the world was also a side-by-side. The Mil V-12 (Figure 9.12)
used the drive trains and rotors of the Mil 6, itself a huge machine, with the rotation
of one system reversed. Side-by-side helicopters have the disadvantage that the pylon
structure needed to carry the rotors invariably causes drag. Considerable masses are
cantilevered at the end of these pylons and it is also difﬁcult to obtain enough structural
rigidity.

9.7

Coaxial helicopters

The coaxial helicopter conﬁguration was frequently seen in the experimental period as
the contra-rotation offered torque cancellation. However, the coaxial machine also has
some idiosyncrasies in autorotation and once the single rotor machine was perfected
the coaxial was simply too complicated except for special applications. For use on
naval vessels, where hangar space is limited, the absence of the tail rotor allows a more
compact hull for a given load capacity. The Kamov machines demonstrate that amply.
The coaxial conﬁguration has also been used with success on unmanned helicopters.
Provided that the two rotors are not too far apart, the coaxial rotor system in the
hover behaves very much like a single rotor with the same total solidity. This is not
true if the vertical separation is signiﬁcant, because if the wake of the upper rotor has
started to contract the lower rotor will encounter increased inﬂow velocity and will

controls usually run inside the mast.

thus need more power. However, this power loss may be cancelled by the fact that the
lower rotor recovers the swirl energy of the upper rotor.
The coaxial helicopter needs two swashplates as can be seen in Figure 9.13. The ﬁrst
connects the stationary cyclic controls to the lower rotor, and the second allows the
cyclic control to pass from the lower rotor to the upper rotor. The cyclic control thus tilts
both rotors in the same sense. The collective control will apply the same pitch change to
both rotors. Yaw control is commonly obtained by differentially changing the collective
pitch. This requires rotating mixers to add the cyclic inputs from the swashplates to the
collective inputs that generally pass up the centre of the mast. The resulting mechanism
is incredibly complicated as a study of a Kamov rotor head will show.

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 362 — #16

Other types of rotorcraft 363

Fig. 9.14 In powered ﬂight, with equal pitch on both rotors there is no net torque. Increasing the pitch of the
upper rotor causes its blade reaction to rotate back whilst that of the other rotor rotates forward and a yaw
results.

Figure 9.14 shows how the yaw control works. The machine is in a power-on condition
so the blade reactions will be tilted back with respect to the shaft axis. The vector sum
of these two reactions is vertical so there is no net torque and no yaw effect. Figure 9.14
shows that increasing the pitch of the upper blade will increase the thrust and tilt it
back against the direction of rotation. At the same time the pitch of the lower blade is
reduced. This will reduce the thrust and tilt it forwards, with the direction of rotation.
The vector sum will now be non-vertical so that there is a net torque turning the hull
the same way as the rotor whose pitch has been reduced.
In autorotation, the yaw control of a coaxial machine using differential collective is
problematic as it may have no effect, or a reverse effect. This was initially not appreciated, and caused some hair-raising moments. Figure 3.14 introduced the autorotation
diagram and Figure 9.15 shows an autorotation diagram appropriate for coaxial helicopters. Here the horizontal axis is the average angle of attack of the two rotors. In
autorotation, the blade pitch will be chosen for the best rotor L/D at the bottom of the
drag bucket. In most helicopters, the lower collective stop is set at the intersection of
the α–θ line and the drag bucket. However, when differential collective is used for yaw,
the pitch of one of the rotors can be even less and so operation can be to the left of the
intersection. The problem is that when operating at L/Dmax. , an increase in pitch or a
decrease in pitch will have the same effect: the rotor experiences more drag and slows
down. At some collective settings there is no yaw control at all. To make matters worse,
helicopter designers often select blade sections having a relatively ﬂat bottomed drag
bucket. If the collective stop is slightly lower than the setting for L/Dmax. , increasing
the pitch will reduce drag and reducing pitch will increase it. As a result the yaw control
reverses.
To overcome the problem, coaxial helicopters need a signiﬁcant amount of vertical
tail area to give yaw stability in autorotation. The ﬁns are often slatted to prevent
stalling at high angles of attack. In some machines a mechanism is ﬁtted so that the
action of the pedals is automatically reversed when the collective is fully lowered.
An alternative yaw control mechanism for coaxial helicopters was seen on the
Gyrodyne helicopter. This consisted of drag brakes in the blade tips that could be

have the desired effect. According to where in the drag bucket the rotor is operating, the yaw control may have
no effect or may even reverse.

extended in one or other rotor. This approach has the advantage that there is no
reversal in autorotation.
Another suggestion for yaw control is the use of a friction brake between one or other
of the rotor shafts and the hull. A moment’s thought will reveal that with a conventional
transmission this would not work. If the coaxial helicopter simply has two shafts driven
in opposite directions at the same speed by the same input shaft, applying a brake to
one of these has no yaw effect at all, but simply slows down both rotors. In order to
use brakes, the two rotors have to be driven with a differential gearbox that allows one
rotor to speed up as the other slows down. Subject to this complexity, the friction brake
system has the advantage of signiﬁcant reduction of rotating linkage as there is then
no need for differential collective or tip drag brakes. There is also no control reversal.
In forward ﬂight the coaxial helicopter has the advantage that the retreating blade
of one rotor is on the opposite side to the retreating blade of the other rotor. This
means that if a suitably rigid rotor head assembly can be built, the lift trough due to
a retreating blade can be overcome by the lift from the advancing blade of the other
rotor and higher forward speed becomes possible.

9.8

The synchropter

The synchropter is a helicopter having two contra-rotating synchronized rotors
mounted side by side that are deeply meshed. Figure 1.17 showed that the rotor shafts
are set on pylons and are tilted outwards so that the blades of one rotor can pass over
the head of the other. In machines having two-bladed rotors the blades are phased 90◦
apart so that one blade is safely oriented fore and aft when the other passes overhead.
The synchropter principle was invented by Anton Flettner and used on his successful
Kolibri (hummingbird) helicopter.
Although there is no tail rotor, there is no consequent safety advantage. The outward
tilt causes the rotors to pass close to the ground at the sides. Synchropters are usually
placarded with warnings to ground personnel to approach from the front. Aerodynamically the synchropter is similar to the coaxial helicopter in that the efﬁciency loss of

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 364 — #18

Other types of rotorcraft 365

a lower blade working in the downwash of an upper blade is offset by swirl recovery.
The lateral separation of the rotors means that the disc area is greater than the area of a
single rotor and this reduces the disc loading and the induced power needed, although
some of the advantage is lost because the rotor thrusts do not align. The horizontal
components of the rotor thrusts are in opposition and some power is wasted. In forward
ﬂight the rotor separation gives a better disc aspect ratio.
From a performance standpoint, the twin rotor heads cause a drag penalty and the
synchropter is not appropriate for high speed. However, as the synchropter is practically
limited to two-blade rotors, it naturally suggests low solidity and disc loading which is
the ideal for low speed, high altitude work or heavy lifting.
The synchropter is controlled in a similar way to the coaxial helicopter in that differential collective pitch is used as a yaw control. This will be subject to reversal in
autorotation as for the coaxial helicopter. Some yaw control is also possible by the use
of differential fore-and-aft cyclic, although the short distance between the rotor heads
makes this ineffective. The usual fore-and-aft cyclic control affects both rotors equally,
but the lateral cyclic may be adapted so that the discs tilt outwards more than they tilt
inwards in order to preserve clearance between the heads and the blades. Generally
synchropters have poor yaw control and require a large amount of ﬁn area.
The outward tilt of the rotors means that the torque cancellation is not perfect. It
can be seen from Figure 9.16 that although the torque cancels in the vertical axis, there
is a component of rotor torque in the horizontal axis which is the same for both rotors
and therefore adds. If the synchropter is arranged to have the advancing blades on the
inside, the torque reaction will tend to pitch the hull nose up until the CM is far enough
ahead of the masts to counter the torque. In the hover this will require the application
of forward cyclic so that the rotor thrust remains vertical. In forward ﬂight the forward
CM is a useful stability aid. As forward speed builds up, the drag on the hull will act
below the rotor heads and produce a couple tending to tilt the hull nose down. The
rotor torque will counter this. Consequently there is a correct way for synchropter
rotors to turn, i.e. with the advancing blades on the inside.
The Flettner 282 Kolibri (Figure 1.4) was not only the world’s ﬁrst synchropter, it was
also the world’s ﬁrst production helicopter, beating Sikorsky’s R-4 by several months
as well as being technically superior. The Kolibri had very closely meshed two-bladed
rotors. Figure 9.17 shows that these were fully articulated with friction disc dragging
dampers. There was substantial ﬂapping hinge offset so that the rotor blades would not
ﬂap into contact with the opposite head. This allowed space for the feathering hinge
to be mounted inboard. The swashplates and pitch links were a compact and elegant
arrangement. A 160 hp BMW radial aircraft engine mounted in the conventional
aircraft attitude drove the transmission through an inclined shaft. The foot pedals

operated the rudder as well as the rotor yaw mechanism. The pilot could also change
the angle of incidence of the tail plane.
The Kolibri was an advanced machine; it had adequate power and was highly
manoeuvrable. In a mock dogﬁght with a Focke-Wulf 190 the ﬁghter was unable to get
the Kolibri in it sights. Following the end of the war, a signiﬁcant amount of advanced
German technology found its way to various allied countries. In the USA, Charles
Kaman recognized the potential of the synchropter principle and combined it with the
servo-tab control system to produce a highly successful series of machines. The Kellet
Co. made some synchropters with three-bladed rotors but these had blade contact
problems and did not reach production.
Kaman’s early synchropters were piston engine powered, culminating in the HOK-1
into which was shoehorned a 600 hp radial aircraft engine, which still wasn’t powerful
enough for some purposes. The piston engine simply isn’t suitable for helicopters above
a certain size. The world’s ﬁrst turbine engine helicopter was a Kaman synchropter, as
was the world’s ﬁrst twin turbine helicopter. Kaman’s most well-known synchropter is
the H-43B, aka Husky. It was also known as the Pedro, after a call sign originally used
at a Texas air base. The Husky was basically a redesign of the piston engined H-43A
using a turbine and it became a classic piece of industrial design. The compact turbine
engine was placed on the roof behind the transmission, resulting in a large, open cabin
accessed by rear clamshell doors as well as sliding doors at the side. The servo-tab
control system meant that the forces needed from the pilot were quite low even though
there was no power assistance.
The yaw control was aided by relatively wide rotor head spacing and an automatic
yaw reverser to make the pedals work in the correct sense in autorotation. The Husky
also had an impressive array of vertical ﬁn area to maintain directional stability when

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 366 — #20

Other types of rotorcraft 367

the yaw control was fragile. The provision of a large ﬁn area is a problem in coaxial
helicopters and synchropters as Figure 9.18 shows. There is a wedge of space in which
the ﬁns can exist. The top of the wedge is deﬁned by the rearmost ﬂapping of the rotors
and the bottom of the wedge is deﬁned by where the ground will be in a ﬂared landing.
The difﬁculty is that the further back the ﬁn area is, the more effective it is. However,
the further back the ﬁn, the smaller it has to be. The only solution is to use a number of
parallel ﬁns. The early Huskys had a habit of knocking the tops off their ﬁns. This was
solved with a redesign, although expedience dictated making the top and bottom ends
of the ﬁns from glass ﬁbre that would disintegrate in any extreme manoeuvre without
causing any further damage.
Another difﬁculty with ﬁns in helicopters is the wide range of directions the airﬂow
can come from. This makes it hard to maintain the optimum aspect ratio of the ﬁn.
The Kaman Husky solved this problem very nicely by mounting the ﬁns on a ﬂoating
elevator that would align itself with the airﬂow. Figure 9.19 shows that the ﬁns were
then always correctly oriented.
The Husky had very low disc loading giving it excellent lifting ability and high altitude
performance. In 1961 a Husky reached almost 33 000 feet! The torque cancelling of
the synchropter meant that pilot workload was quite moderate and the lack of a tail
rotor meant it could land in difﬁcult terrain. The Husky distinguished itself as a rescue
helicopter, particularly where crashed aircraft had caught ﬁre. The Husky would hover
overhead, using the downwash to blow ﬂames clear of the ﬁre ﬁghters and victims.
The Husky was superseded by conventional turbine helicopters that were faster, but
a number of surplus machines found their way into logging and aerial work where
speed was not of the essence. Their success in this niche led Kaman to produce the

K-Max: basically the mechanics of a Husky with a minimalist single-seat hull optimized for underslung load working. The K-Max is the only synchropter currently in
production. As the K-Max is a single-seater, a number of Huskys have been refurbished
to act as trainers.

9.9

The tandem rotor

Once the stress-reducing beneﬁts of blade articulation became known, contra-rotation
could be adopted in the tandem. This largely cancels torque reaction. Claims will often
be seen that because there is no tail rotor to waste power, the tandem must be more
efﬁcient than the conventional helicopter. This is not necessarily true because the two
rotor discs may overlap reducing the total disc area. In fact the real advantages of the
tandem are that the position of the centre of mass is much less critical than in single
rotor machines and that hovering is much less sensitive to wind direction. In military
operations the ability to hover on any heading, load in a hurry and simply ﬂy off saves
valuable time. Later Chinooks have three load hooks in line beneath the hull so that
supplies can be taken to three locations in one ﬂight. This would be impossible with
a single rotor machine because it could not handle the CM travel as the loads were
dropped off one by one. Figure 9.20 shows that if the CM position is not in the centre
the trim will be operated so that the rotor at the ‘heavy’ end produces more thrust and
the other rotor produces less. A secondary effect of this condition will be that there is
not a perfect torque balance and some yaw control will be required.
It is quite possible to construct a tandem rotor machine in which the two rotor discs
are separated. The Florine machines and the Piasecki ‘Dogship’ (Figure 9.21) had this
conﬁguration. This approach results in a long and possibly heavy hull and a physically
large machine requiring a lot of hangar space: a drawback in naval operations. As a
result in modern tandems the two discs will be signiﬁcantly overlapped such that the
distance between the rotor heads is less than the rotor diameter. The rotors must be synchronized by a shaft joining the front and rear gearboxes so that, like the synchropter,
the two rotors can share the same airspace without clashing.

Fig. 9.20 The tandem conﬁguration can deal with longitudinal CM offsets using a different amount of thrust
on each rotor.

Other types of rotorcraft 369

Fig. 9.21 The Dogship was Piasecki’s ﬁrst tandem rotor helicopter and was widely demonstrated to attract
interest in the principle. It was the forerunner of the ‘ﬂying bananas’ and the Chinook. (Boeing)

Fig. 9.22 The transmission system of the Chinook showing the synchronizing shaft between the rotors and
the twin engines.

Chapter 5 described the interaction between the main and tail rotor of a conventional
helicopter. In the hover it was seen to be highly variable with wind direction, whereas
in translational ﬂight there was a beneﬁcial weathercocking effect. In the tandem the
interference between the two rotors in the hover is beneﬁcially almost independent of
wind direction, whereas in forward ﬂight it is detrimental to stability. Consequently it
is simplistic to claim that one conﬁguration is better than another. In some areas the
conventional approach is superior, but in other areas the tandem wins.
Figure 9.22 shows the transmission arrangement of the CH-47 (Chinook) in which
the two engines drive the synchronizing shaft via one-way clutches so that either engine
can drive both rotors. It is interesting to note that except for the use of piston engines,
the Florine III of 1935 had the same transmission layout. As the dominant masses and
the rotor forces are both concentrated at the ends of the hull, the structure needs to be
stiff against bending and torsion. The loss of disc area due to the overlap of the two

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 369 — #23

370 The Art of the Helicopter
discs causes some loss of aerodynamic efﬁciency, generally of the same order as the
loss due to driving the tail rotor in a conventional machine. However, the shorter hull
will be lighter and have less area exposed to downwash so the overall lifting capacity
remains about the same.
In forward ﬂight the tip path axes must be tilted forward just as in a single rotor
machine to obtain a forward component of thrust. Figure 9.23(a) shows that in practice

(b) The front pylon is aerodynamically treated so that it creates drag rather than lift in a sideslip. (c) The rear
rotor works in the vortex structure of the front rotor and has higher inﬂow.

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 370 — #24

Other types of rotorcraft 371

the rotors are mounted so that they remain substantially in the same plane in translation. This allows the rear rotor to operate in relatively clean air. In order to keep the
cabin level and to provide blade clearance, the rear rotor is mounted on a pylon. It is a
characteristic of this approach that ground clearance of the front rotor disc is relatively
small. However, the poor clearance exists directly in the pilot’s ﬁeld of view. With no
tail rotor to weathercock and a short moment arm, a large amount of ﬁn area is usually
needed and even then tandem rotor machines are aerodynamically marginal in yaw.
This is not all bad because many operations require the machine to hover at an
arbitrary orientation to the prevailing wind and the tandem does that very well. The
rear pylon is always shaped to act as a substantial ﬁn and the front pylon may have
aerodynamic treatment to stop it acting as a ﬁn. This may consist of irregularities
designed to cause early ﬂow separation when the relative airﬂow is off the fore-and-aft
axis. Figure 9.23(b) shows that the resulting drag causes a smaller yaw component than
if the pylon caused lift.
Figure 9.23(c) shows that the rear rotor is affected by the front rotor vortices in
translational ﬂight. Effectively the rear rotor is operating with a greater inﬂow velocity
than the front rotor. In a machine with a central CM, both rotors will need to produce
the same amount of lift. To develop the same thrust the rear rotor will need to use
a higher blade pitch and will absorb more torque because of the higher inﬂow. The
swirl of the forward rotor also acts asymmetrically on the hull. For these reasons the
torque is not precisely balanced in translation. One prototype tandem helicopter could
not initially ﬂy in a straight line in translational ﬂight because these effects were more
powerful than the yaw control. Once the nature of the problem was understood a
solution was not far behind.
There are ways to mitigate the problem. An obvious suggestion would be to move
the CM forward. Whilst this would work, it somewhat negates the advantage of CM
position freedom. In practice, the two rotors can be set at a different angle. Figure 9.24
shows that the front rotor shaft may be inclined forward with respect to the rear. This
is done on the CH-47 in which there is a 5◦ difference between the angles of the shafts.
This increases the inﬂow seen by the front rotor and decreases the lift component of
its thrust, whereas the inﬂow of the rear rotor is reduced and the lift component of its
thrust is greater. Another possibility is that the ﬁn can be built with an integral camber
so that in translational ﬂight it produces a side thrust. The cambered ﬁn of the CH-46
is obvious in a rear view.
The interference between the rotors can be minimized by ﬂying the machine sideways as this increases the diameter of the stream tube and improves the aspect ratio,

Fig. 9.24 The front and rear rotor shafts may be inclined at different angles.

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 371 — #25

372 The Art of the Helicopter
giving greater translational lift. This technique works well in a steep climb. The drag
of the broadside hull will be a problem as speed builds up. However, some advantage
can still be gained by ﬂying with sideslip; 15◦ is a typical ﬁgure. Some piston-engine
tandems used as plane guards during carrier operations were operated in this way
as standard procedure. In a twin-engine machine, sideslip operation may be used to
handle one-engine-inoperative conditions. The direction of sideslip is important as the
downwash from the front rotor is not symmetrical.
The tandem rotor market is one many manufacturers have stayed away from. In
the UK, the most successful tandem was the Bristol Belvedere (Figure 9.25) designed
by Raoul Hafner which started life mechanically as a pair of Sycamore mechanics
with a synchronizing shaft and which subsequently evolved into a capable twin turbine. Yakovlev built a large tandem machine in the USSR but this was not successful.
In the USA Bell built the HSL but it did not enter production. The name most closely
associated with the tandem is that of Frank Piasecki whose early fragile canvas covered creations, dubbed ‘ﬂying bananas’ from the bent hull needed for rotor clearance,
matured into the enduring CH-46 and CH-47.
The CH-46 is about as attractive as a tandem can get and when it was ﬁrst built its
good lifting capacity and amphibious capability made it a favourite with the US Navy
who use it for vertical replenishment (VERTREP) which is military-speak for moving
material from one ship to another suspended below a helicopter. The army liked the
concept but wanted something with a bigger cabin and the CH-47 was born.
The CH-47 Chinook is a superb piece of industrial design by any reference. The
basic design dates from 1961 and because it is fundamentally well founded it is simply upgraded from time to time. It is amazingly versatile and genuinely amphibious.
In other words it can operate normally from water rather than just ﬂoating in an
emergency. The absence of a tail rotor means that it can land in scrub.

Fig. 9.25 The Bristol Belvedere was a twin turbine military machine that was successful in service despite
frequent ﬁres caused by its absurd engine starting system. (AugustaWestland)

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 372 — #26

Other types of rotorcraft 373

For easy loading, the Chinook is designed around a constant cross-section cabin
with a rear ramp. The fuel and undercarriage are housed in two long side sponsons
that provide stability on water and cause no intrusion into the load space. For similar
reasons the engines are placed above the cabin, and the synchronizing shaft and control pushrods run in a hump or spine above the cabin. The immense rear pylon/ﬁn is
used to house the engine combining transmission, the oil cooler, the rear gearbox and
swashplate actuators, the APU and almost anything else that needs a home with the
result that the hull is kept free for payload.
The control system of the tandem rotor helicopter is more complex than in a tail
rotor-type machine. The rotor heads need to be articulated for reasons that will be
seen. Figure 9.26(a) shows that the swashplates tilt simultaneously for roll control and
tilt differentially for yaw control and to oppose any residual torque imbalance. They
move up and down together for thrust control and differentially for fore-and-aft (pitch)
control and to handle CM shifts. All of this is achieved in a Chinook in a diabolical
mechanical mixer located in the control closet behind the port pilot’s seat which takes
the inputs from the pedals, cyclic stick and thrust lever (tandemspeak for collective)
in the cockpit ﬂoor and adds and subtracts in various ways to obtain four pushrod
outputs which go into the roof, one to control each side of each swashplate. The conceptual mechanism is shown in Figure 9.26(b). The autopilot is incorporated in an
unusual fashion. Electrical autopilot signals and mechanical pilot inputs are supplied
to small duplicated hydraulic actuators in the control closet located before the control
mixer. These are called integrated lower control actuators (ILCA) and they operate
the control mixer. The mixer pushrod outputs are then led to duplicated high pressure
hydraulic actuators at the swashplates. These actuators have mechanical inputs. This
approach allows a conventional autopilot to output yaw, pitch, roll and thrust commands to the airframe. If the autopilot had to control the swashplate actuators directly,
an autopilot mixer would have been needed.
When the cyclic stick is pushed forward, differential collective pitch increases the
thrust of the rear rotor relative to the front rotor (Figure 9.27(a)). The hull is tilted
forward about the pitch axis (b) and this makes both rotor shafts tilt relative to the
tip path axes. This hub tilt causes a cyclic feathering effect such that both rotors pitch
forward to follow the hull (c). This is the control mechanism used in hovering.
In order to move into forward ﬂight, forward differential collective is maintained
so the machine gathers speed. The lift asymmetry due to translational ﬂight in both
rotors will cause the tip path axes to ﬂap back with respect to the two control axes as
shown in Figure 9.28(a). At a given airspeed, this results in a larger change in cabin
ﬂoor angle, reduced blade clearance at the rear of the front rotor, more hull parasite
drag and a large amplitude of ﬂapping and dragging at the rotor heads because of the
large differences between the tip path and shaft axes.
Thus in practice a tandem helicopter requires means to apply forward cyclic control
to both swashplates in translational ﬂight as a function of airspeed. Figure 9.28(b)
shows that this results in closer alignment between the tip path and shaft axes, reducing
the amount of ﬂapping and dragging and improving the clearance of the front rotor.
In the Chinook the fore-and-aft cyclic controls are not connected to the cyclic stick.
Instead they are driven by an automatic system which is airspeed sensitive and starts
to apply forward cyclic at speeds above about 70 knots. The application of forward
cyclic to reduce ﬂapping will also tend to increase the airspeed. To compensate for this,
a series actuator, known as the DASH actuator, in the fore-and-aft cyclic pushrod is
also operated by the automatic system in such a way that the pilot sees a fairly constant
positive gradient between cyclic stick position and airspeed which is not impaired by
the automatic forward cyclic control of the swashplates. The DASH actuator can be
seen in Figure 9.26(b).

376 The Art of the Helicopter
The yaw control is by differential tilt of the rotor thrust and clearly if there is no rotor
thrust there will be no yaw couple. If rotor thrust reverses the yaw control will reverse.
Whilst this is not a problem in most ﬂight conditions, a zero-g pushover could result in
loss of yaw control. A crop-dusting turn or return-to-target manoeuvre is also difﬁcult
for a tandem because when the hull is pointing straight up after the ﬁrst quarter loop
the rotors need to be set to ﬂat pitch and this removes the yaw authority. Consequently
the tandem will perform a variation on the manoeuvre in which the yaw is commenced
during the quarter loop. Momentum carries the yaw on during the ﬂat pitch phase.
The tandem is generally designed to have a level cabin in translational ﬂight and
when at rest on the ground. This means that in the hover the cabin will slope down to
the rear and the machine must touch down with the rear wheels ﬁrst. This allows an
interesting taxi mode where the rear wheels are carrying a signiﬁcant weight but the
front wheels are clear of the ground. Forward speed can be controlled by rear wheel
brake and steering is possible by applying the brakes differentially.
The waterborne characteristics of a tandem are worth a few comments. The contrarotation means that the rotors can be started and stopped whilst aﬂoat without the
machine rotating as a single main rotor machine would. The built-in tip path plane tilt
causes a tendency to forward motion when the hull is ﬂoating level. When aﬂoat the
acrylic cockpit chin windows are partially submerged, and whilst this is not a problem
whilst stationary, water taxiing at speed will put them under tremendous stress. To
avoid this, pilots will lift the nose in a water taxi. The ﬂoor of the cabin is sealed to
act as a raft for use on water and the ramp can be lowered whilst aﬂoat to deploy or
recover small boats or swimmers.
In the tandem rotor helicopter the rotor heads are designed to meet different requirements. The yaw control is obtained by tilting the two rotor discs laterally in opposite
directions. Effective yaw requires that the tip path axes actually make a signiﬁcant tilt
and the ﬂapping hinges are needed to allow this to happen. If conventional heads with
signiﬁcant ﬂapping hinge offset are used, the result of an application of the yaw control
is a serious twisting couple applied to the fuselage. Thus for a tandem rotor helicopter,
the ﬂapping hinge offset needs to be signiﬁcantly reduced. This need not reduce the roll
response, because a roll is obtained by applying lateral cyclic to both rotors in the same
sense. As there are two rotors, each rotor only needs to apply half the roll moment.
In order to prevent heavy underslung loads reducing the lateral cyclic authority the
main load hook is on rollers and can traverse a curved lateral beam whose centre of
curvature is near a line joining the rotorheads.
In the Chinook, the ﬂapping hinges are provided with a relatively small offset for the
above reasons. If the dragging hinges were coincident with the ﬂapping hinges there
would be a large drag angle change between the power-on and autorotation states and
there would be little space for drag dampers. Instead the dragging hinges are placed outboard of the feathering hinges. This arrangement works very well and the only drawback
is that when the blades are stationary gravity causes them to swing about the dragging
bearing. These are not necessarily vertical, being outboard of the feathering bearings.

Remotely piloted and radio-controlled
helicopters

In some cases putting a pilot in a helicopter is not the right thing to do. Without a pilot
the helicopter can be much smaller, or it can lift more. The pilotless helicopter can also

ﬂight.

be used for tasks in which there is a signiﬁcant risk. Pilotless aircraft are often called
drones and the term is also applied to pilotless helicopters.
Small remotely controlled helicopters can be used for reconnaissance and may escape
detection or prove very difﬁcult targets if they are detected. Small helicopters have
also been developed for crop dusting, notably in Japan. However, the limitations of
the helicopter apply to small ones equally. Small ﬁxed-wing drones can be launched
from a simple ramp and recovered by parachute and will have greater range than
the inefﬁcient helicopter. Consequently drone helicopters are very rare indeed and ﬁll
extremely specialized niches.
The drone helicopter may depend entirely on a remote pilot, or it may be entirely
autonomous so that it can complete an entire mission automatically. Early drones were
totally pilot controlled and had to stay within sight of the pilot. Subsequently the drone
could relay a television picture of the view from the cockpit so that the drone could
be ﬂown out of sight. As electronics developed, it became possible to integrate the
helicopter controls with autopilot functions and control the whole with a navigation
system. This led to the UAV (unmanned air vehicle) concept that can be applied to the
helicopter as well as it can to the aeroplane.
In the absence of a pilot the UAV designer has much more freedom. The contrarotating coaxial rotor is popular as it avoids the use of very small and delicate tail
rotors. Figure 9.29 shows a typical UAV having coaxial rotors. The hull is axially
symmetrical and high speed forward ﬂight can be achieved by tilting the whole machine
over. Tilt-rotor UAVs have also been developed.

9.11

Radio control principles

Radio control is simply the use of radio signals to relay the position of control sticks
without any physical connection. In practical applications there will be a need to have
several control channels simultaneously available and each one will need to be proportional, which means that small or large movements of the control stick will be remotely
reproduced by the movement of a servo.
The foundation of this technology was a patent by A.H. Reeves in the 1930s which
showed that any type of information could be carried by varying the width or distribution of pulses. In a helicopter, the actual ﬂying controls require four simultaneous

“helic - CHAP09” — 2003/11/22 — page 377 — #31

378 The Art of the Helicopter
control channels. These will be lateral cyclic, fore-and-aft cyclic, collective and tail
rotor. Subsidiary controls will be needed to start the engine and rotors and to adjust
RRPM.
In an analog or pulse width modulation (PWM) system, each control is connected
to a transducer such as a potentiometer or LVDT (see Chapter 7) that controls the
length of a pulse. There will be one pulse for each control channel, followed by a reset
or synchronizing pulse. The pulse signal is used to amplitude or frequency modulate a
carrier wave in a radio transmitter. A receiver tuned to the transmitter will be able to
demodulate the carrier signal and recover the pulse train. The reset pulse sets a pulse
counter to zero. Each control pulse is then counted so that each pulse is routed to the
correct channel.
A PWM system is analog because the inﬁnitely variable position of a control stick
results in an inﬁnitely variable pulse length. In practical systems the resolution of
the system may be reduced because of noise in the radio link. The digital or PCM
(pulse code modulation) system converts the position of each control stick to a binary
number of ﬁxed word length. In an eight-bit system, there can be 256 different numbers.
The binary numbers from the various control channels are multiplexed into a single
transmission in which the number corresponding to each channel has a ﬁxed place in
the sequence. The start of the sequence is denoted by a ﬁxed synchronizing pattern.
