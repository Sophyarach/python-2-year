For any

is

obviously a number of candle feet numerically equal to the

At

distances other than one foot the illuminating power
is determined by the well defined, but often misapplied,

law of inverse squares." This law states that the in-

but a very large proportion of the total luminous energy is
concentrated by the reflector or lens system into a nearly
parallel beam which maintains an extremely high luminous intensity at great distances from the apparatus. If
the beam were actually of parallel rays its resultant illumination would be uniform at all distances, save as dimin-

ished by the absorption of the atmosphere, probably not
over 10 per cent, in a mile in ordinary clear weather, since
the absorption of the entire thickness of the atmosphere

for the sun's light

is

only about 16 per cent.

The

searchlight furnishes really a special case of scenic
illumination, which frequently depends upon the use of

concentrated beams in one form or another, so that one
must realize that a very considerable branch of the art of
illumination imposes conditions not reconcilable with the
ordinary application of the law of inverse squares.

standard candle as the unit of light, and adhere to English
measures, the logical unit of intrinsic brightness is one
candle power per square inch.
One then may conveniently express the brightness of any luminous surface in
candle power per square inch, and thus obtain a definite
basis of comparison.

Although a measure of

intrinsic brightness is obtained

by dividing the candle-power of any

light

by the area of

the luminous surface, this latter quantity is very difficult
to determine accurately, since with the exception of the
electric incandescent filament no source of light is anywhere nearly of uniform brilliancy over its entire surface.

In the case of arc and incandescent lamps the thermal
inertia of the filament or carton rod also tends physically

to minimize the changes, but with a low frequency alternating current they may still be serious.

The exact frequency at which an incandescent lamp on
an alternating circuit begins to distress the eye by the flickering effect depends somewhat on the individual eye and
somewhat on the mass of the filament. In general, a i6-cp

Lamps having relatively thick filaments can be worked
at lower frequencies than those of the common sort, so
that so-volt lamps, particularly of large candle-power,
may be worked at 30 cycles or thereabouts rather well, and

out of doors even down to 25 cycles. That is, at a pinch
one can do satisfactory work when current is available at
25 cycles or so, by using low voltage lamps of 32, 50, or

by the way, are capable of giving admirable

results in illumination if properly disposed.

Of

course,

such practice is bad in point of efficient distribution of current, but on occasion it may be useful.

When polyphase currents are available,

as is usually the

case where rather low frequencies are involved, some relief
may be obtained by arranging the arcs in groups consist-

Second, the existence of a shadowless space presupposes

a nearly equal illumination from all directions. If it be

With respect to the best direction of illumination, only

very general suggestions can be given. Brilliant light,
direct or reflected, should be kept out of the eye and upon
the objects to be illuminated. In each individual case the
nature and requirements of the work must determine the
direction of lighting.

The

light should come obliquely over the left shoulder, well
illustrates ordinary requirements.

be obtained by directing it downwards and slightly from

rule is, avoid glare direct or reflected, and get strong diffused light from the object illuminated.

In certain sorts of scenic illumination strongly colored

Absorbing media sometimes show these color changes
very conspicuously; as, for example, chlorophyll, the green

thickness transmits only the dark red rays.
Similar characteristics pertain to many modern dye stuffs, and result,
in connection with the composite reflection which has just
been explained, in some very extraordinary and very beautiful effects.

From what

has just been said about color reflection

it is

obvious enough that the loss in intensity in a reflected ray
may be very considerable, even from a single regular reflection

under quite favorable conditions.

experi-

So far as general illumination is concerned, the light

In the case of ordinary reflecting surfaces one deals with a mixture of
regular and diffused reflection, and in practical illumination the latter is generally more important than the former, for it determines the amount of light which reaches
the surface to be illuminated in

ways other than direct

This color seems thus far to be inseparable from the

If the exploiters of these mantle burners had spent half

wasted in denying the greenish hue of the light or in ex-

driven out of use.

following table is typical of the peculiarities of the light
as compared with that from an ordinary gas flame. In
the table the light of the gas flame is supposed to be

unity for each of the colors concerned, when the light
from the mantle has the given relative values.

As

the actual luminosity of the deep red, blue, and
violet is comparatively small in either burner, the preponderance of green in the light from the mantle is very

marked.

To correct this it is necessary to use a shade of
such color as to absorb some of the green rays. The
actual percentage of light absorbed need not be at all
provided the absorption is properly selective.

THE ELECTRIC INCANDESCENT LAMP.

AT

the present time the mainstay of electric illumination is the incandescent lamp, in which a filament of

high electrical resistance is brought to vivid incandescence by the passage of the electric current. To prevent
the rapid oxidation of the filament at the high temperature employed, the filament is mounted in an ex-

hausted glass globe, forming the familiar incandescent

lamp of commerce.

The first attempts at incandescent lamps were made
with loops or spirals of platinum wire heated by the
electric current, either in the air or in vacuo, but the
results were highly unsatisfactory, since in the open air
the wire soon began to disintegrate, and even in the
absence of air its life was short. Moreover, the metal
itself,

in very limited quantities, was
and rose very rapidly in price under
demand. Having a fairly low specific
resistance, the wire used had either to be very

two short bits of thin platinum wire which are sealed
through one end of a short piece of glass tube. Sometimes these platinum leading-in wires are fastened directly to the ends of the filament and sometimes to an

a strong and durable filament for high voltages. Hence,
lamps for 220 to 250 volts are generally of at least 16
candle-power, very often of 20 or 24 candle-power, and
seldom show an efficiency better than 4 watts per candle-

This forms a serious practical objection to the use of

It is neither desirable nor economical to operate an
incandescent lamp too long, since not only does it decrease greatly in efficiency, but the actual light is so
dimmed that the service becomes poor. If the lighting

in

tion of efficiency, therefore, it becomes desirable to
throw away lamps of which the candle-power has fallen
below a certain point.
Much of the skill in modern lamp manufacture is directed to securing the best possible balance between
efficiency and useful life, a thing requiring the best efforts of the manufacturer. Fig. 36 shows graphically the
relation between life, candle-power, and watts per candle
derived from tests of high-grade foreign lamps. In comparing these, like the previous data, with American results, it should be borne in mind that these foreign tests

are made, not in terms of the English standard candle,
but generally in terms of the Hefner-Alteneck standard,

which is somewhat (approximately 10 per cent.) smaller.
These curves show' the results from lamps having an
initial efficiency of 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 watts per candlepower and an initial candle-power of 16. They show
plainly the effect of increased temperature on the life
of the lamp, and it is unpleasantly evident that in the

neighborhood of 3 watts per candle a point is reached
which a further increase of efficiency produces a dis-

the lamps can be done very cheaply, probably at a cost

not exceeding 7 to 8 cents, but the cost of proper sorting
and testing to turn out a uniform high-grade lamp, and
the incidental losses from breakage and from lamps of
odd and unsalable voltages, raises the total cost of production very materially.

Much

of the reduction in the price

of incandescent lamps in the past few years has resulted
from better conditions in these latter respects, as well

as from the improved methods of manufacture.

And

it

should be pointed out that the difference be-

tween good and bad lamps, as practically found upon
the market, lies mostly in their different rates of decay
of light and efficiency. It is the practice of many of the
large lighting companies who renew the lamps for which
they furnish current to reject and replace lamps which
have fallen to about 80 per cent, of their initial
power.
First-class

modern lamps worked

form of lamp in which the luminosity is not due to the

The

is

strongly disposed to think that the ultimate solution
lies in the latter alternative, although the former offers

hope

of very considerable

and perhaps revolutionary

improvements.
Within the past few years a large number of attempts
have been made at preparing a filament for incandescent

lamps of some material far more refractory than pure
carbon, and hence better able to endure the high temperature necessary for securing high efficiency. A
glance at the temperature curve, Fig. 35, shows that a
rise of 200 degrees C. or so in the working temperature
would produce an efficiency of nearly or quite one candle-

power per watt.
These attempts have been of several kinds. One
method has been to incorporate refractory material with
the carbon in manufacturing the filaments, thus both increasing the resistance of the filaments and giving them a
certain proportion of heat-resisting substances. Owing,
however, to the fact that such filaments still contain a

considerable proportion of carbon which is comparatively easily vaporized, there is good reason to doubt

the efficacy of the process. The carbon, which is the
cement, as it were, once disintegrated, the filament
would give way, and experience up to date has tended
to throw doubt on the success of any such scheme.
An interesting modification of this method is that proposed by Langhans, who forms filaments of carbide of

tinuous spectrum, as does an incandescent solid, but
gives a spectrum of bright bands or lines. This fact of
itself gives some hope of efficiency, for it is the plentiful

production of useless wave lengths that renders an ordinary incandescent body so inefficient a source of light.
If a gas could be found giving a brilliant spectrum of
bands, all of useful wave lengths, one might expect that

a considerable proportion of the energy applied to the
tube would turn up as useful illumination. Or if not
a single gas, then a combination of gases might be found
such as would answer the purpose. During the past ten
years much work has been put in along this line by Mr.
Tesla and others, but ^s yet without the production of a

commercial lamp, although very magnificent effects
have been produced experimentally.
The difficulties which have been met are, first, the need

Now, low intrinsic brilliancy is not in itself at all objectionable, but in the matter under discussion it connotes a radiant of large dimensions. This means that
either there must be an enormous multiplicity of small
tubes or else a few tubes so large as to involve rather
high electromotive force in driving the discharge

through them. In large tubes the light is generally very
unsteady, and the best effects seem to be gotten from
long coiled tubes of small diameter, which are not easy
to excite. As to color, there is a strong tendency toward
a bluish or greenish hue, which will have to be removed

It is obvious that the more energy spent in this crater
the more heat and light will be evolved, and that the
concentration of much energy in a small crater ought to

produce a tremendously powerful arc. It is not surprising therefore to find that the larger the current crowded

tically the two classes often merge into each other or are
combined in various ways.
There is, besides, a considerable class of shades of
alleged decorative qualities, which neither redistribute the
light in any useful manner nor shield the eye to any
material degree.
Most of them are hopelessly Philistine,
and have no aesthetic relation to any known scheme of
interior decoration.
Figs. 54 and 55, a stalactite and

globe respectively, of elaborately cut glass, are excellent
examples of things to be shunned. Cut glass is not at its
best when viewed by transmitted light, and neither diffuses nor distributes the light to any advantage.

considerable care by Mr. W. L. Smith, to whom the author is indebted for some very interesting data on this

subject.

The experiments covered more than twenty varieties of
shades and reflectors, and both the absorption and the
redistribution of light were investigated.
One group of
results obtained from 6-inch spherical globes, intended to
diffuse the light somewhat without changing its distribution, was as follows, giving figures comparable with

Hence only in the case of walls capable of very
brilliant diffusion can the variation due to increased

Fontaine's empirical rule, which, however, possesses the
merit of causing one to err in the right direction and to
give ample illumination.

the assumed conditions are satisfied by allowing as a

about 3.75 sq. ft. per candle-power, or with
allowance for properly softening the light, 2.6 sq. ft

per candle-power.
Lighting such a space from two points only is usually
by no means the best way, and a much better effect

would be secured by using six radiants. The same reasoning which led us to place a and b near the ends of the

for diffusion on the one hand or for ground bulbs and
incidental losses on the other.
Setting these off against each other, it appears that
the conditions call for 15, i6-cp lamps in each of the six

They are somewhat preferable to incamlescents, too, when colored objects are to be illuminated.

the choir, and 20 to each transept. As to position, the
most efficient method would be to put them in groups
of six or eight on brackets between the windows, at half
to two-thirds the height of the wall, with possibly larger
groups massed at the four corners of the crossing.

With still more lights available very beautiful results
could be attained by adding lights at the capitals, and,
in some cases, along the tie-beams, or on the brackets

All incandescent

lamps used without diffusing shades should have ground

In lighting with gas, brackets are about the only
thing feasible, since the flames must point upward, and

few capitals would fail to look overloaded with adequately shaded burners. Mantle burners, of course, do the
work most efficiently, but used alone the effect is certain
to be grimly utilitarian, and especially around the choir

Large public buildings are generally easier to light
than churches, since they are, as regards the shape of
the several rooms, comparatively simple and are seldom
dark in finish. Many rooms may be illuminated along
the lines already laid down, but, on the whole, powerful
radiants, such as arc lights, may be more freely used
here than elsewhere, thereby effecting a very considerable

economy.
In high corridors and high halls without galleries arc
lights can be used with very excellent results.

In the absence of such shadows the

in point of fact, the object of lighting streets is

neither to enable one to read a page laid flat on the pavement nor to observe a surface perpendicular to the ray.
But the intensity and distance of the radiants is determined by the minimum illumination allowable midway
between lights, and not by the brightness of the regions
near the poles, and in these comparatively dimly lighted
spaces the things which must be observed and for which
the users of streets keep their eyes open are things not

To

255

determine the real illumination produced at any

distance by a particular radiant, it is necessary to take
the assumed height and the distribution curve for the
radiant,

and then to compute the illumination

at that

distance, using the real candle-power corresponding to
the direction of the ray considered. To save labor it is

convenient to plot the illumination at various distances
in the form of a curve, thus enabling the illumination in
candle-feet to be read directly.
Fig. 99 shows a set of curves thus computed from the
four types of arc lamps, of which distribution curves

were shown in Fig. 97. The first important lesson to

For purely decorative purposes the miniature lamps

Regular incandescents are

As the purpose of the searchlight is to give a parallel
beam of light, the carbons between which the arc is

formed are not in line, but staggered, as shown in Fig. 1 19
so that the crater of the arc points obliquely backward,
and the carbons are tilted so that this crater faces fairly
the apex of the mirror instead of its aperture.
An opaque
disk between the arc and the mirror aperture cuts off all
stray direct light, so that all the light sent out is delivered
from the mirror in a nearly parallel beam. The whole
affair is mounted in a case having rotation about a horizontal and a vertical axis, forming the familiar device

facts in practical lighting which has been many times

suggested in these pages, and which lies at the root of
improvements, is the need of keeping down intrinsic
brilliancy.

The

true criterion of effective

and

efficient lighting is

not simple illumination, which resolves itself into a pure
matter of candle feet, but visual usefulness, which takes
account of the physiological factors in artificial lighting.
If one denotes the illumination measured in candle feet
or other convenient units by I, then the visual usefulness
is measured by the product / <r, where a is proportional
to the effective area of the iris.
This of course is constantly shifting as the illumination changes, but, broadly,
it is an inverse function of the intrinsic

radiants used.

whatever the candle-power of the light, the visible diffusing surface must not exceed a brilliancy of 5 cp per square

candle-power, that amount of light must be scattered over

:

hand, a certain amount of the inwardly incident light is
actually intercepted by the shade; on the other hand, the
diffusion is not uniform, especially if the radiant has great
intrinsic brilliancy and the shade is fairly translucent.
For heavily ground or fairly dense opal shades the above
ratio is not far from right, the modifying factors tending
to offset one another.
Such shades intercept about one-

third of the total light as a necessary feature of keeping
the intrinsic brilliancy within bounds, so that it is not

unfair to say that for most practical purposes 100 candlepower in a radiant of really low intrinsic brilliancy is as
useful as 150 candle-power in a very intense radiant.

Now practically all our modern sources of light
require shading, if within the field of vision. The obvious
moral is that one of the great economies in lighting is
centered in keeping the radiant out of this field.
In electric lighting, incandescent lamps at 3 watts
per candle area so disposed as to keep clear of the field
,

of vision, are fully as valuable illuminants as lamps at 2
watts per candle wrongly installed, so as to either dazzle
the eye or to require shading to avoid it.

must be for hygenic reasons whenever visible.

In actual practice it is a matter of great difficulty to
place lights wholly out of the field of vision, and the more

them.

The

an open arc taking about 450 watts was rated at 2000
candle-power, while a similar arc of about 325 watts was
rated at 1200 candle-power.
While it is possible that some experimenter at an
especially favorable moment may have obtained these
intensities in a

it

is

certain that the

ratings were very soon regarded as merely conventional.
They have long since been relegated to the category of

merely commercial designations, the rating bearing no
more precise relation to the thing than does the term

is the general understanding of the
term as interpreted at various times by the courts. There
is not, nor has there ever been, in commercial use in this
country or elsewhere an arc lighting system using lamps
actually giving anywhere near 2000 candle-power, either

maximum zonal intensity or as mean spherical intensity.
The former requirement would demand about 750 watts
at the arc, the latter nearly 1200.
Lamps of such power

in a horizontal plane 45 degrees from the plane of the

With the introduction of looped and spiraled filaments
giving a better distribution of light than the simple U-

shaped filament, demand arose for a method of measurement which would credit these lamps with their just due.
Hence arose the measurement of mean horizontal candle-

power by rotating the lamp.
