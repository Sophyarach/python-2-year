Forward
The purpose of this first book of a four book series is to train the student in the methods,
principles and techniques of European Medieval Martial Arts, focusing on dagger,
grappling and the longsword. This work was originally created to form the basis of the
recruit training program for the Academy of European Medieval Martial Arts or
AEMMA. References for this work include
but are not limited to historical documents and
treatises such as Fiore dei Liberi, 1410, "Flos
Duellatorum", Hans Talhoffer, 1459, "Alte
Armatur und Ringkunst" , Hans Talhoffer,
1467, "Fechtbuch aus dem Jahre 1467", Jakob
Sutor, 1612, "Künftliches Fechtbuch"
The Academy’s mission is to resurrect the
combat skills, philosophies, principles of an
accomplished European Medieval martial
artist and to achieve a state which would be
consistent with that of a medieval warrior in
both technology and ideal.” The goal of this
organization is to resurrect European medieval martial arts to the same level as today’s
Asian martial arts schools and academies, and to re-establish medieval combat as a viable
21st century martial art alternative. The objective is to not only achieve realism in the
discipline of armoured and un-armoured combat, but also the philosophy and principles
that surrounds this form of martial art.
In order to support the Academy’s mission and goal, this document along with the
companion instructor’s guide entitled “The AEMMA Longsword Instructor’s Guide” was
written to provide the reader with the necessary reference and tools to train oneself and
others in this form of martial art.
Book 1 provides the recruit/student with the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve
the rank of scholler. All training and instruction builds upon what is learned at each
level. Upon completion of this level of training, the student will be competent in
performing all of the basic guard stances, fundamental offensive forms, drills and possess
a basic historical knowledge of the martial art. A companion student’s training guide
provides the outline for the training program including the structure of the oral
examination to be taken at the end of this training.

Training Overview
The objective of this manual is to provide the student with a structured and detailed guide to
follow for the purpose of training in the historical medieval martial arts and to prepare the student
for the challenge for the prize of “scholler”. This manual is not intended to replace the principle
historical sources, but is intended to augment them.
The medieval longsword, langeschwert, or spada longa, was a specialized form of the “knightly”
cruciform sword that developed in the early 13th century. Although it initially developed to
combat reinforced mail armour, by the mid-15th century, the longsword had also become a
“dueling” weapon in the city streets of Europe. This style of swordplay became so popular that
sparring matches are recorded in Germany as late as the mid-18th century, two hundred years after
the weapon’s usefulness on the battlefield had long since died out.
The introduction to the medieval grappling, dagger and longsword is designed to provide the
student an intensive overview of the weapon and the basic techniques of its use. Upon completion
of the course, the student will have a working knowledge of the historical terminology and
techniques of the medieval masters, and will have been exposed to a wide variety of concepts,
drills, and sparring/fighting sessions. This course presents the initial concepts that provide the
framework for AEMMA’s medieval swordsmanship, and is expanded upon the later skills levels 1 .
In the end, the skills learned by the student through this training program can, in effect be used in
today’s modern combat situations (well, except for the sword) because the combat techniques are
consistent with today’s fighting situations. Therefore, from a personal enhancement perspective,
if a student wishes to learn the art of self-defence against an attacker poised with a knife, or
perhaps simple hand-to-hand engagements, even though the techniques are sourced from the 14th
or 15th centuries, these techniques are also employed in today’s modern combat training
programs. The end result of this training for both men and women are:
a) Contributes to the individual’s overall strength, flexibility, balance & cardiorespiratory
fitness;
b) Build’s individual courage, confidence and self-discipline.

Training Objectives:
Academic: To provide the student with a historical overview of the medieval longsword, and its
role in the history of historical swordsmanship.
Practical: To present a sequence of routines, methodologies, solo and partner drills, that will
provide the groundwork for fighting with the longsword in a style derived from northern Italian
and German sources of the 14th through to the 17th centuries.

Basic Principles
The following briefly describes the basic fight principles that the student must know and apply to
successfully defeat an opponent. These principles are consistent with today’s combat training
systems.
a) Physical Balance
This refers to the student’s ability to maintain his/her equilibrium and remain in a stable fight
position during an engagement. This is critical for deploying a defensive maneuver or posture,
and for launching an effective attack against the opponent. There are two aspects of balance that
the individual must possess:
• The student must develop the ability to move the body, utilizing such concepts as passing
steps and gathered steps as an example, and to ensure that the feet do not cross and are
kept apart at approximately shoulder’s width. Also the need to lower the body’s center of
gravity to enhance stability.
• Through training and experience, the student must also be able to move his/her body in
an engagement to maintain balance and stability, while at the same time, exposing the
opponent’s weak points.
b) Mental Balance
A successful student must also maintain mental balance, in that he/she must not allow fear or
excitement to overcome his/her ability to concentrate or react skillfully during a fight.
c) Position
This refers to the location of the student in relation to the opponent. An important principle when
being attacked is to move the body to a safe defensive position in order to prevent the student
from being hurt. Then, the student would look for a counter-attack opportunity. This principle
would apply in both armed and unarmed engagements. Movement to an advantageous position
will require accurate timing and distance perception.
d) Timing
The student must learn though experience, the best time to move to an advantageous position in
an attack. If the movement is too soon, the opponent will anticipate the movement and deploy a
counter or adjust his/her attack. Similarly, if the student moves too late, the opponent will be
successful in delivering his/her strike or attack at the instant when the student is most vulnerable.
e) Distance
This describes the relative distance between individuals engaged in a fight. The student must
learn how to position oneself at a distance that is most advantageous. Adjustments to this
distance is continuous during an engagement to ensure that the student maintains the most
advantageous range between himself/herself and the opponent.

f) Momentum
A critical principle that the student must learn to acquire is the understanding of the physics
behind momentum. Momentum describes the body’s tendency, while in motion, to continue in the
direction of motion unless acted upon by another force. The greater the mass or speed of the
movement, the greater momentum. This is a key principle that can be effectively employed
during longsword attacks, whereby the student can leverage the momentum of an attack, and
redirect the momentum behind the strike, and counter (parry) with an attack. This principle

applies to other forms of attacks, and provided the student understands the principles behind
momentum, the following can be deployed:
v The student can use the opponent’s momentum to the student’s advantage by introducing
an imbalance on the part of the opponent by exploiting the opponent’s own momentum.
v The opponent’s momentum can be exploited by forcing it to extend further than is
expected by the opponent, thus causing imbalance.
v The student must also be aware that the opponent can also use the student’s own
momentum to the student’s disadvantage, and therefore, must avoid placing the student in
an awkward and vulnerable position.

Safety Precautions
In order to prevent injuries or at least reduce the probability of injury during training and
fighting, the student must consider the following before and during training:
1. The student must follow the instructor’s direction, instructions and guidance, and if
unclear, request clarification.
2. The student must not get ahead of the instruction, regardless of the skill the student may
possess.
3. The student must offer no resistance and must allow each maneuver to be freely executed
during training stages to allow for the perfection of the movement.
4. The student shall be cleared of any jewelry, watches, chains, etc. that might interfere with
the drills and possibly result in injury.
5. The student understands that strikes are to be simulated, especially during the learning
stages. It is not important to be quick nor to place any power behind the strikes.
6. The students must learn to establish a consistent signal to indicate to the partner to stop
applying pressure delivering sword strikes during training drills.
7. The student must undergo an adequate warm-up exercise period, along with stretching to
reduce the possibility of injury.
8. The student will ensure that the required protective equipment is worn during training
drills.
9. Periodically, the student must inspect their equipment to ensure that it is kept in optimum
condition. If the equipment is deemed unsafe, or not optimal, the instructor will terminate
the training for that student which requires the equipment.

Training Program Structure
This first book will provide the student with the fundamentals of defense and offense, an
understanding of the underlying physics of the longsword, the anatomy of the longsword
and an introduction to training drills that are critical to developing skill and competency.
This book introduces the student to the historical sources that were used in the
development of this training system. AEMMA’s training system is the result of the
research conducted on the historical sources identified in this book as well as many hours
of “reconstructionist” effort to ensure that the training system is both viable and
comprehensive. This level of training in this book will position the recruit to successfully
challenge for the prize of a scholler rank.
The basic training principles that the students must internalize includes:
1. basic sword exercises and movements
2. footwork
3. competency in sword technique
4. ability to redirect and/or manipulate your opponent
5. ability to direct your opponent without physical contact
Training is comprised of a number of sections, each with it’s specific objective. The
following describes the sections that form the longsword training program.
1.0 Exercise Forms
"Therefore let every man that is desirous to practice this Arte, endeavor himself to get
strength and agility of body, assuring himself, that judgement without this activity and
force, avails little or nothing." Giacomo di Grassi, 1570.
The above statement rings true in that in order to achieve perfection in any craft or skill,
practice...practice...practice... is required. The swordsmanship training program is no
different. The exercise forms enhance flexibility and strength with respect to wielding
the sword. Therefore, the exercises are repetitive, difficult and long. Discipline forms
the core of the training program.
In the opening of every training session, the students are positioned into a circle, each
able to see the other and everyone able to see the instructor without any obstructions and
a ritual opening of the training is delivered by everyone. Then warm-ups without the
sword follow the opening. Other exercise forms will incorporate the sword, which is why
the sword is placed on the floor at the feet, at approximately 45o from the vertical with
respect to the student. This reflects the student's "readiness" to arm himself/herself in the
event of a surprise attack.
Some suggestions for warm-up exercises can be found at the end of this manual in
Appendix B.

The sword arts require a commitment to cardio and muscle training outside of class time.
It is highly recommended that students do further training as described in Appendix C
“Augmenting Training”.
2.0 Other Weapons Training
The purpose of training with other weapons is to expand and enhance the student’s
“experience” with respect to longsword training by incorporating training drills based on
other weapons types. These would include unarmed or grappling combat techniques
(some aspects of “ringen” from Talhoffer’s manuscript), unarmed vs. knife combat
(Talhoffer, Liberi and Marozzo) and knife vs. knife (Talhoffer, Liberi and Marozzo).
Many of the subtleties of combat cannot be adequately learned and trained with when the
focus is only on a single weapons type, and therefore, this training system presents
certain elements to expand one’s expertise and experience in martial training.
3.0 Deployment of Strikes and Guards
Students are instructed the variations and deployment of strikes, guards and wards from a
trajectory perspective, physical attributes such as stance, angle of attack, parrying and redirecting, integration of footwork, and drills. They are performed repeatedly by the
student, along with variations introduced into the drills. In any delivery of a strike or
deployment of a guard must demonstrate absolute control and discipline when wielding
of the blade. Any delivery must be able to be stopped instantly by the student in order to
change strategy, direction or execution of the form. These forms practiced in this
component will be used as a basis for sequences of delivery and deployment which are
comprised of one or more strikes and or parries. These basic forms must be internalized
and delivered naturally and with fluidity. Sword drills are initially employ wooden
wasters and in later ranks utilize combat-ready, steel swords, depending upon level of
competency.
4.0 Folgen (Sword Drills)
The term "folgen" is a German term that means "following". It adequately describes the
aspect of training comprised of sword drills. The term "folge" is more of a singular term,
that means "follow". The purpose of the folgen is to introduce the student into structured
contact drills. This will begin the process of striking an opponent with the sword, and to
receive strikes in which the student invokes an appropriate defensive form. The practice
drills in this level provide the student the opportunity of practicing in a highly structured
drill in which all offensive and defensive forms are used with a partner. Each student will
take turns in progressing through an offensive and defensive drill. Portions of the drills
incorporated into the AEMMA training program are comprised of the classic "Moulinet"
drills devised by Capt. Alfred Hutton as described in his works "Old Sword-play", 1892.

Each student, when practicing in pairs will take turns progressing through an offensive
and defensive folgen. The ultimate objective of the folgen in later levels of skill is to
achieve full free-form fighting. The folgen in later levels of competency can include
practice with steel swords, however, in this level of training, the students are limited to
wooden wasters only.
When the student is familiar with the folgen, depending upon the competency levels,
structured sword fighting and free-form sword fighting may be introduced with wooden
wasters provided the minimal protective equipment is available.
5.0 Reihenfolgen (Sword Sequences)
The reihenfolgen are series of patterns of movements which contain a series of logical
and practical attacking and blocking techniques. Although it is not known if this form of
training was used in the medieval period, the reihenfolgen are an extremely useful
mechanism to practice the offensive and defensive forms outside of the training
Academy. The objective of the reihenfolgen is to enhance the fluidity of movement of the
sword, increase the students confidence and comfort wielding a sword, provide a safe and
relatively structured mechanism for steel-to-steel demonstrations, and to facilitate
training so that the student can use their skill at a more rapid pace. In each reihenfolgen
there is a certain set of predetermined movements which the student can practice alone,
without a partner. Some reihenfolgen have been created by the Academy as a result of the
research of medieval swordsmanship and medieval training, and others are borrowed
from sources such as Hutton’s manuscript2 (moulinet). The utilization of the techniques
in the reihenfolgen evolved from and have been tested in the Academy during training
and research. In this way, each sequence has been improved and refined, and have
evolved into the sequences practiced in the Academy today.
6.0 Fechten (Fighting Engagements)
An effective way of incorporating the techniques and principles from training is to apply
them in fighting engagements. This is known as “fechten” or fighting. To fight is
referred to as “fecht”. This is an old German word which is referenced in historical
documents written by Talhoffer and others previous to him. These were known as
“fechtbuch” or fighting books.
At this level of training, fechten is done with wasters only. Simple techniques are
practiced at ½ speed, under the close supervision of the instructors. As students progress
to higher levels (not covered in this book), steel swords and armour are utilized and the
speed and intensity of the fechten is increased.

Ranking and Skill Competency
The ranking system described below is based on a similar ranking system first employed
by academic institutions around the 15-16th century to determine the individual's position
within a hierarchical system of competency. Ranking includes five (5) distinct levels:
recruit, scholler, free scholler, provost and maestro. The word "scholler" is derived from a
Latin word "schola" or "school". Therefore, given that a scholar or "scholler" (old
English) is someone who studies an academic subject (using the "under-graduate student"
analogy), this was found to be applicable to the initial rank of a western martial arts
student. Taking this further, a "free scholler" is one who is undergoing advanced training,
similar to a graduate student from an academic perspective. The academic or research
component of this ranking system begins early in the "scholler" rank during the student's
training with his/her participation in an existing or ongoing research project.
The designation of "provost" is granted by the school’s governing body and is achieved
when the student has achieved the highest technical skill of a weapon and that a research
project is completed along with a research paper submission. A "provost", by definition is
an individual who is the head or master of a particular college or subject.
Using this definition with respect to martial arts would also include
weapons skills, relevant techniques and their surrounding history. One
can use the analogy that a "provost" has obtained a doctorate in this
particular weapon's type. A "maestro" is one who has been granted this
title by an external governing body such as the International Masters at
Arms Federation (IMAF 3 ) and who has achieved the highest technical
and intellectual skills with a minimum of three (3) weapons types (an individual who
holds multiple "Ph.D's").
One of the most important steps in the progression from the rank of scholler to maestro is
the concept of "prizes and challenges". The quest for the prize of promotion is a
fundamental cultural component of the Academy, in which most, if not all students desire
to obtain the prize through a minimum of 3 challenges against individuals in the next
rank desired for each weapon currently being trained in. The play for the prize is
comprised of two steps. The first step occurs as an event internal to the Academy in
which the student's skills are assessed in private by the AEMMA governing body. The
second step is for the student to submit a challenge for the prize of scholler, however, no
student is allowed to submit challenges until the private examination is complete and
deemed successful. There is no real time span before the student can play for the prize
once the challenge has been submitted, however, it is usually left up to the student. Only
the recruit and scholler has this prize option in the promotion to scholler and free scholler
rank respectively. Higher ranks prizes are governed on a time basis structure.
The expectation of training is that the student, with regular practice and commitment can
achieve the highest ranking and competency level, maestro in approximately 5 to 10

years. This has great variations, depending upon the commitment of the student to
training, attendance to classes, research project development, availability of the student to
training, physical capabilities, stamina and their natural physical skills of the student.
Skill and safety are paramount in the training program. The ranking and competency
levels are described below.

The rank of maestro can only be designated by an external body such as the International
Masters at Arms Federation or IMAF. All of the responsibilities and attributes of a
provost extend to this rank. The only additional responsibility may be the active
participation on the governing body of IMAF by invitation, providing the maestro with an
international responsibility with respect to the promotion and formalization of historical
fencing.
Criteria of the Candidate for the rank of Maestro
• The candidates that have access to an IMAF master and must train with him/her
for an appropriate period of time.
• The candidate must be presented to the examination board by that master training
the candidate. Candidates that do not have access to an IMAF master locally may
test for masters certification by presenting an independent study and paper. This
study must encompass all of the requirements and criteria of IMAF.
• A formal letter of intention to test with the International Masters at Arms
Federation must be initially submitted by the candidate. Following this, a formal
presentation must be made of his/her study which must be representative of the
work and research that the candidate has done to that point. All work must be

Overview of Historical Manuscripts Referenced
The training program is based on a number of treatises written during various periods
between the 13th and 15th centuries. These manuscripts, or portions of them are
available in the online library on AEMMA’s web site located at http://www.aemma.org
Fiore dei Liberi, 1410
“Fiore dei Liberi of Cividal d’ostria was born sometime between 1340 and 1350 born in
Cividale del Friuli, a small town on the river
Natisone in Italy. Given that he had written the
treatise "Flos Duallatorum" between the years
of 1409 and 1410, and that according to the
information in the prologue of the manuscript,
he had been practicing the art of
swordsmanship for 50 years at the time of his
writing, the birth year is an estimate. With the
exception of what is written in the prologue of
this treatise, very little is known about Fiore
dei Liberi. The illustration on the left depicts a
portion of the prologue. What the prologue
does describe is that his family is of noble
origin, however, but not well placed. He
initially learned the art of swordsmanship as a
child and young man in his village where he
fought in friendly assaults and duels as was the
custom in that period. However, in order to
learn the art from the best of his time, he left
his village and went to Germany to learn and
train in swordsmanship under the direction of
the scholar Johannes Suvenus (a former
scholar of Nicolaus con Toblem). The knowledge he acquired under Suvenus’ direction
elevated Fiori dei Liberi to a master swordsman of
his time. He participated in numerous battles in
and around Italy for the last 20 years of the 14th
century. In 1383 he fought in Udine on the side of
the town during the civil war. In 1395 he was in
Padua for a duel and four years later in 1399 he
was in Pavia. Little is known of his life and deeds
around this time until the beginning of 1400 when
he entered the court of Niccolo III d’Este,
Marquise of Ferrara, as the master swordsman.
He acquired a commission in the early 1400s as a
master swordsman on behalf of Signore di
Ferrara. He then began to write the manuscript for the nobility on behalf of Signore di
Ferrara. In 1410 Fiore dedicated his treatise to his Marquise. After 1410 there are no
records of his life or of his death.” Massimo Malipiero: “Medieval Swordfighting”.

Flos Duellatorum, or 'Flower of Battle' is primarily composed of illustrations with short
rhyming captions in Italian. Sections include wrestling, dagger, sword, spear, two handed
sword, armored combat, pollaxe, and mounted combat. There is also a considerable
discussion of disarming techniques. Longsword, dagger and grappling has the greatest
attention in the manuscript. The figure on the bottom of the previous page is an example
of one of the illustrations that depicts the posta de coda longa or long tail guard.
“Unknown”, c1470
The original Solothurn publication of 'Das Solothurner Fechtbuch' is thought to be
written sometime in the late 15th century. This may be supported with an inference to
Paulus Kal which could date the manuscript
no earlier than c1470. It has recently been recompiled and published by Zentralbibliothek
(Central Library), Solothurn, Switzerland in
1989 by a Swiss gentleman by the name of
Dr. Charles Studer. The re-compiled
manuscript was prepared from the surviving
30 plates of the original 60 which contains 57
illustrations of the original 120 that illustrate
a number of techniques such as armoured
longsword, mounted fighting, dagger,
grappling (ringen) and shield work which appear strikingly similar to those illustrations
found in Talhoffer's works. Studer's publication focus was on the cultural and legal
context of the judicial combat engagements depicted in the original manuscript. Dr.
Studer, neither a swordsman nor fencer did not possess the authourity on historical
European martial arts and therefore his interpretative comments are suspect.
Hans Talhoffer, 1467
Talhoffer's fechtbuchs or "Fight Books" survive in at least 3 editions; 1443, 1459 and
1467. This manual is based principally on Talhoffer's fechtbuch of 1467. Talhoffer's
'Fechtbuch aus dem Jahre
1467' or 'Fencing Book of the
Year 1467' was re-printed in
Prague, 1887 by an officer in
the Austria-Hungarian
Empire by the name of
Gustave Hergsell.
Although little is known
about the "man", we do know
that Hans Talhoffer was born
in "Swabia", a relatively
small area of Southern
Germany which now lies chiefly within the present states of Baden-Wurttemberg and
Bavaria. This region derived its name from the Suevi, an ancient Germanic tribe which

settled in the area during the great migrations of the fifth century. Swabia has a history of
martial tradition, and by the fifteenth century of techniques its master swordsmen, such as
Johannes Liechtenauer, had influenced fight manuscripts both in Germany and Italy.
An unfinished fechtbuch of 1389 written by Hanko Döbringer, who was possibly a
student of Liechtenauer, documents much of his masters' theory. The German medieval
swordsmanship pedagogy can be traced back to Liechtenauer, who lived during the 14th
century and traveled Europe to learn the mysteries of armed combat. After his death, his
pupils began to document his works and methods so as to preserve the principles and
methods. It is clear that medieval swordplay was not the brutal hacking as often depicted
in modern films, but rather sophisticated methods of timing, placement, positioning,
judgment, avoidance, footwork and manipulation. The following is an extract from
"Setting The Record Straight: The Art of the Sword in Medieval Europe", Galas, M.:
"Despite his failure to complete his work, Döbringer manages to convey the theoretical
basis for the German art, which is surprisingly modern in tone. Concentrating on the
importance of seizing the
initiative, on maintaining the
offensive, and evading the
opponent's attempts to find the
blade, Döbringer at times sounds
like a modern epee coach. In
another section, Döbringer
discusses the time advantage of
the thrust over the cut - a
theoretical concept usually
ascribed to the Italian rapier
masters. In addition, Döbringer
describes how Liechtenauer
divided the opponent's body into four target areas - a division still used in modern
fencing. Finally, dispelling the misconception that medieval swordsmen relied on
strength alone, Döbringer states that a weakling using Liechtenauer's art would be as
likely to win as a strong man. In summary, Hanko Döbringer's observations make clear
that medieval fencing masters - at least in Germany - had developed their art to a much
higher degree of sophistication than they have previously been given credit for."
The work of the Swabian fight
training system was not confined to
Germany. Another famous writer,
Fiori de' Liberi claimed to learn and
train in the art of swordsmanship
under the direction of the scholar
Johannes Suvenus, a Swabian.

spends a fair amount of time frothing at the mouth about
the folly of the new fangled Italian rapier play, as
opposed to the English sword. He provides some
interesting discussion on the proper use of sword and
buckler, two-handed sword, dagger, various pole-arms,

in the manuscript including the infamous 4 governors,
true and false timing and the 4 grounds. More on this is

Jakob Sutor, 1612
Sutor's 'Neu Künftliches Fechtbuch' was originally written in Frankfurt in 1612 and then

covering the "langen
schwerdt" or long
sword. These include
the classic guards and a
few pages devoted to
grappling techniques.
He follows this with
coverage of the
"dusaken" or dusack. A
dusack is essentially, a
large, elongated "meat
cleaver", one sharp
edge, slightly curved blade with an integral hand grip. It has a certain resemblance to a
large machete. It is unclear if the dusack were made out of metal or were originally
employed as wooden weapons for training purposes only. His works concludes with
ample coverage of the rapier, rapier and dagger trailing with a few pages covering poleweapons.

Mess. H. Angelo and Son, 1790
The “Hungarian & Highland Broad Sword” is a
beautifully illustrated manuscript containing very little
text but includes 24 black and white plates depicting
mounted guards, and cuts and thrust forms utilizing the
Hungarian broad sword. This sword is very similar to the
sabre in general shape, except that the broad sword
appears to be a more hefty weapon than the sabre. The
plates were originally designed and etched by T.
Rowlandson, under the direction of Mess. H.Angelo and
Son. Mess. Angelo and son were the fencing masters to
the Light Horse Volunteers of London and Westminster.
The manuscript was dedicated to Colonel Herries.
Alfred Hutton, 1889
Hutton's "Cold Steel: A Practical Treatise on the Sabre" is based on the old English
backsword play of the 18th century and is combined with the method of the "then"
modern Italian school. This manuscript also includes
other weapons including the short sword-bayonet, the
constable's truncheon, and knife techniques (based on
Marozzo's earlier works). With respect to the sabre,
discussion surrounds the guards, moulinet, cuts, points,
timing and distance, aspects of all forms of swordplay.
Alfred Hutton, 1892
Hutton's “Old Sword-Play”
was part of a triad of great
Victorian practitioners of the
sword, the other two being
Sir Richard Burton and
Egerton Castle. As a
Victorian, Hutton partakes
of all the limitations of his
school. He completely
discounts all swordsmanship
before the 16th century. He
takes a progressive view of swordsmanship, which presumes evolution towards greater
and greater "perfection", although he does not show this nearly as heavily as do Burton or
Castle. He also is very prone to extending the techniques of his own time and school into
the past, whether or not it was appropriate. However, taking these limitations into
account, his work is an adequate introduction to the techniques of swordplay from the
16th through 18th centuries--provided the student goes on beyond Hutton.

Brief History of Armour
11th Century Arms and Armour (to approximately 1066 AD)
The figure below illustrates a typical hauberk of the 11th Century extending to mid thighs
or knees with loose sleeves. Although the illustration is derived from a 12th century
manuscript “Life of St.Guthlac”, the chain mail adequately illustrates the typical
armouring of the 11th century extending to mid thighs or knees with loose sleeves and the
coif integral with the hauberk. Over the coif is a steel cap with a nasal bar protecting the
face. Wealthier knights and those of importance may also have had chausses or mail
leggings laced across the back of the calf.
Under the hauberk can be seen a loose form of
tunic or gambeson to prevent chafing from the
rings of the mail. Some type of padded garment
may have also been worn over, or in place of, the
plain tunic shown. Later in the 11th century, loose
fitting surcoats were worn over the mail. Often
these were white or other light colours to help
reduce the heating effect of the sun during battle.
The figure carries a large kite type shield with a
supporting strap or “guige” over the right shoulder.
The sword of this period is carried on a sword belt
around his waist. The lance is shown shortened in
the figure, but would usually have been about 7
feet long.
The helmet used by the Saxons was usually of
spangenhelm type, made of iron plates overlaid on
the outside with sheets of gilt copper secured by
silver-capped nails. This form of construction and
decoration remained unchanged for centuries. The
nasal guard was characteristic of the Norman
helmets. Most warriors during the Battle of
Hastings often wore mail hoods or “coifs”
underneath their helmets.

12th Century Arms and Armour (to approximately 1180 AD)
The individual in Figure 2 is wearing a hauberk that extends to his mid thighs or knees
and to his wrists. He has an integral coif covered by a steel
bowl-shaped or conical helm with a nasal bar protecting the
face. Under the mail is worn a gambeson as they did in the
previous century to prevent chaffing by the mail. The
chausses or mail leggings were much more popular in the
12th century. These were worn by lacing with leather straps
behind the leg and calf. Normal for this period would be a
large heater shaped shield with a supporting strap over the
right shoulder. The sword typical of this period is carried on
a sword belt around his waist
Both the arms and feet were now more commonly protected
with mail than in the previous century. In the last few
decades of the 12th century, the sleeves of the hauberk
became longer, ending in mitten-shaped mail gloves called
“mufflers”, which were slit at the wrist to permit the hands
to be withdrawn at will. The palms were not covered with
mail, since this would impede one’s grip of a weapon. Early
forms of mufflers left the fingers and thumbs exposed.
Figure 2 (left)
Armouring of
the 12th
Century
Long and
usually
sleeveless full-skirted cloth gowns called
“surcoats” were typically worn over the
mail towards the end of the 12th century.
These first appeared in the second half of the
12th century but did not become widely
popular until the 13th century. Figure 3 on
the right from the Winchester Bible
illustrates knights wearing surcoats. It is
possible that they developed through the
influence of the Crusades. Armour worn
under the intense sun of the Middle East
would have been uncomfortable to wear.
The compromise was to wear light coloured
surcoats to deflect the worst of the sun’s rays.

13th Century Arms and Armour (to approximately 1275 AD)
Figure 4 below illustrates Sir Roger de Trumpington, a brass form from Trumpington
Church, Cambridgeshire. He wears a scabbard attached to
the sword belt by thongs. His hauberk extends to his mid
thighs and is the sleeves extend to the wrists, often ending in
mufflers or mitten-like extensions with an opening which
could be closed with a lace just below the wrist. He has a
separate coif that covers his shoulders. Under the coif is a
steel cap which accounts for the irregular shaped head.
Over the hauberk is worn a surcoat which was often of fine
material - silk - and may have been embroidered, the bottom
edge showing a finished, dagged, edging. This is held in
place by a thin cord or leather belt tied about the waist.
Numerous reasons for the surcoat have been brought forward,
including that the surcoat was worn over the armour to
simply keep the armour clean. Another suggestion is that
they were a garment modelled on the flowing robes of the
Saracens, designed to keep the armour cool in the heat of the
Holy Land. Finally, they may have been adopted to display
the wearer’s coat of arms.
Under the hauberk is worn a gambeson to protect from
chaffing by the mail. The chausses are augmented by cuirboulli5 protecting the knee caps. This is an example of the
beginnings of the development and integration of plate
armour. These were normally used to divide the chausses and
provide intermediate support of the heavy mail around the
knee. It is thought that a single piece of mail from thigh to
foot could impede ease of movement.
He has a heater type shield suspended by a strap or “guige”
over his right shoulder. The sword typical of this period is
carried on a sword belt hung over the hips allowing the
weapon to hang at the front of his body angled slightly
forward. There were two common helmet designs during this
period. The first being the “chapel de fer” or kettle hat.
Figure 4 Armouring of the 13th Century
It resembled a medieval cauldron or kettle. The other consisted of a round bowl with a
wide brim, assembled from number of plates riveted together, as was the earlier
“spangenhelm”. A second helm was the “great helm” similar to the one illustrated behind
the head in the above figure. This was extensively used by the knightly class and was
often worn with a coif. It also had a guard chain attachment to prevent the loss of the
helmet during battle.

14th Century Arms and Armour (to approximately 1385 AD)
Figure 5 below illustrates Sir John d’Abernon, c1340 in the Parish Church of St. Mary,
Stoke d’Abernon, Surrey. It shows armouring typical of this
century, including a basinet form of helmet and aventail.
The armour of the 14th century was characterized by the
increased useage of plate armour made of various materials,
including latten (a brass-like copper alloy), whalebone, iron and
steel. For the duration of the 14th century, the knight would
continue to wear a chain mail hauberk. The hauberk only
reached to just below hip level, sleeves extending to the wrist.
Mail chausses were worn, covered with plate armour on the
legs, called “greaves” strapped with leather behind the legs.
After mid 14th century, the arms were frequently completely
covered in plate armour and the arm protection was completed
with a pair of gauntlets. In the latter half of the century, breast
plates made their first appearance. During the latter part of the
century a body defense known as a “brigandine” was
developed. This was a piece of body armour which followed
the principle of a coat of plates.
During the beginning of the 14th century, the helmets followed a
globular basinet design, along with an attached aventail of mail.
However, the great helm remained in use for the most part of
the first half of the 14th century. Later the skull component
became so tapered that it formed a truncated cone and the side
and front of the helm were extended downwards to almost rest
on the shoulders and chest of the wearer. This evolution in the
design facilitated the deflection of a downward thrust of a sword
or battle axe. In the early half of the century, helms were often
provided with pivoted visors.
In the beginning of the century, a knight still wore a surcoat or
flowing gown over his armour.
Figure 5 Armouring of the 14th Century
This may have proved to be a hindrance while fighting on foot. Often, illustrations
depicted the surcoat tucked up into the belt. Later, the front of the gown was shortened to
expose the bottom of the coat of plates. By mid 14th century, it had risen to knee level
both at the front and the back. The illustration above left depicts an earlier version of the
surcoat.
A garment known as coat of plates was also worn. In the illustration above, it is depicted
just below the surcoat and jupon. Often they had heraldric devices affixed to the surcoat
or jupon in order to display their identification on the battle field and tournaments.

15th Century Arms and Armour (to approximately 1499 AD)
Figure 6 below illustrates armour made for Archduke Maximilian (later, the Emperor
Maximilian I) created by Lorenz Helschmied of
Augsburg, c1480. The beginning of the 15th century
witnessed the development and exportation of an
“international” style of armour. The production of
armour was centred in two geographical regions,
northern Italy, (centred in Milan) and Germany. The
most important armour production centres in
Germany were Augsburg, Landshut, Nuremburg and
later, Innsbruck. As the century progressed, both
countries developed a distinct style of armour. The
kettle and basinet proved to be the most popular with
the German knights during the early part of the 15th
century. Another common form of helmet was the
“sallet” which probably derived from the 14th century
basinet. The illustration on the left depicts a sallet
style helmet.
To complete the defenses, gauntlets were worn. Until
about the mid century, the typical hour-glass form of
the 14th century were worn. A new form of gauntlets
appeared around this time, which resembled a mitten.
This mitten gauntlet was constructed with a one-piece
main plate which was shaped to the base of the thumb
and had a slight bend along the knuckles. Later, the
Germans produced a fluted style with ribs, and with
finger lames. Occasionally, gauntlets had separate
fingers, and cuffs so long that they reached the elbow.
The Italian armours were more rounded in design, as
opposed to the “fluted” Gothic lines favoured
by the Germans. The Italian armour gave their armour
a more utilitarian and robust appearance. This was
accentuated by increased armour integrated into the
body armour on the left side. Body defenses were
first influenced by the Italians until approximately
1420. There was little distinction between the
German armour from the rest of Europe. Later, a new
Figure 6 Armouring of the 15th Century
breast plate appeared known today as the “kastenbrust”. It had a boxy appearance,
whereby the top of the breastplate sloped outwards and downwards from the chest,
angling sharply to the waist to form a deep undercut.

Anatomy of the Sword
The student must become familiar with all aspects of the sword, its construction, the
material and the components.
The first thing the student must learn is that there are two edges to the sword. The “true”
edge and the “false” edge. The true edge is the edge that is facing and which will strike
your opponent. The false edge is facing you. If the sword is flipped, the false edge will
now become the “true” edge and the true edge becomes the “false” edge.
The figure below illustrates the components that make up a sword. What is not seen is the
“tang”. That is the narrowed portion of the blade, on which the grip is attached. The
pommel keeps the hilt assembly in place.

The best defense is in the forte (strong) area of the sword, near your guard. This is the
area of the sword that you will parry with. The least defensive area for parrying is the
foible (weak). The opponent will have more control over your weapon when parried in
this area. The guard can also be used to disarm your opponent and pommel can also be
offensive by striking your opponent.

The center of percussion or COP of the sword is also known as the “sweet spot” of the
blade. This is the point on the blade, which experiences the minimum vibration as a
result of the blade being struck or striking another blade or target. When the blade comes
into contact with a target, a shockwave passes through the blade. The blade possesses a
natural “harmonic” balance in which the blade will experience areas of maximum
vibration and minimum vibrations. The points of maximum vibration are the “crests” and
the points of minimum vibration are the “nodes”. The COP is one of these nodes on the
blade, and it is the node that experiences the least amount of vibration in the blade. The
COP is generally located approximately 2/3’s to ¾’s of the length of the blade from the
guard or quillon. If the blade is struck at this point or COP, the energy of the shockwave
will travel to the target instead of into the shaking blade. A second node rests near the
guard. This position of this node on the blade side of the guard will dramatically reduce
the vibration felt by the hands gripping the hilt and reduce tiring of the grip. A well
structured sword, i.e. a sword that possesses good harmonic balance will not transmit the
shock to the hands on the grip when struck.
Balance Point from Guard
The balance point from guard or BPG, is also known as the “center of gravity” of the
sword. It is where the sword, if suspended by a string would remain level to the floor.
The BPG on most swords should fall 4-6 inches ahead of the guard for a broadsword and
approximately 22%-23% of the distance from the tip of the pommel to the tip of the blade
for rapiers. It is not clear from any ancient documents and treatises if these characteristics
were understood or were considered when constructing swords.

The Grip for the longsword
Proper grip is critical to ensure a high degree of control, accuracy and stamina with the
hands. If one grasps the sword with a "death-grip", similar to one gripping a baseball bat,
one will tire very quickly. However, if the grip is somewhat relaxed and optimally
placed on the grip and pommel, one will be able to endure long periods of time in combat
with little tiring.

The fundamental principle employed is that you "steer with the right and brake with the
left". This means that the most, if not all of the maneuverability is managed by the right
hand (assuming you are right handed, the reverse is true for left handed grips). The left
hand is used to either apply more power to the strike by tightening its grip or to play a
major role in the "pulling the shot" by applying the "brakes". The grip could be
described as similar to holding a "fishing rod". The grip is relatively relaxed in order to
"feel" the sword, and force is applied when it's needed.
The left hand is positioned somewhere in the neighbourhood of the pommel, or right on
the pommel. Gripping the pommel with the left hand offers the greatest control and
leverage when delivering a strike.
To test the appropriate grip, grasp the grip area of the hilt as you would a fishing rod.
While you are grasping the sword, have a partner grasp the sword near the point and raise
the point to almost a vertical position. The grasp on the grip does not change in position
nor alignment with the floor. The partner should be able to simply pull the sword from
the grasp, which indicates that there is little pressure on the grip. Returning the sword to
a horizontal position, you will notice that if you try to pull the sword from the grasp, it is
difficult if not impossible. This clearly indicates that much of the support of the sword is
the natural leverage and pressure points offered by a relaxed grip.

Theory and History
The purpose of this section is to provide some of the necessary theoretical and historical
information necessary to satisfy the scholler requirements. It is extremely important that
the student begin to develop a deep level of understanding of swordsmanship and all the
aspects that surround it, i.e. the theoretical aspects as well as the historical aspects. Most
material is available on the AEMMA website at http://www.aemma.org, while others will
require some investigation on the part of the student.
The student must review and study the works written by historical masters that include
Fiore dei Liberi, Hans Talhoffer and George Silver. The units below will aid in
identifying the salient points that should be understood from each manuscript.
1) Fiore dei Liberi – 1410
Liberi documented a very systematic and complete training manual for the development
of contemporary martial art skills of the time. Liberi recommends that this training
system not be used to train thugs, given the techniques are sophisticated and deadly.
Thugs would not possess the self-discipline to control when and when not to employ the
techniques described. He begins the training program with grappling. Although students
of the sword would prefer to begin training with the sword, Liberi reasoned that those
students who are committed to learning the way of the sword would remain throughout
the earlier levels of training and develop an appreciation of the skills learned and
recognize how these skills can be leveraged to longsword or pole-weapons training.
Those students that are not cognizant of this leave the program early – a good filtering
mechanism. The AEMMA training program structure is heavily influenced by this
approach by Liberi and is clearly visible in its structure with respect to recruit training.
The student undergoing this level of training will consider the following point:
i.

review the classical Italian nomenclature and description of each of the posts
and guards found in his manuscript entitled “Flos Duellatorum”

2) Hans Talhoffer – 1467
This manuscript was one of the first that received attention by the western martial arts
community. An initial re-publication of this manuscript by VS Books, Hearne, Germany
suddenly made this manuscript available to the fledgling western martial arts community
back in 1998. Since then, a new publication by Mark Rector has provided the WMA
community with the same German treatise in English.
The difference between Talhoffer and Liberi is that it appears that Talhoffer’s manuscript
is simply a collection of techniques, many quite interesting and considerably
sophisticated. It is implied that one that studies this manuscript, should have a good basis

of skill and expertise in order to successfully utilize this manuscript. The student will
need to consider the following points:
i.
ii.

iii.

review the section on “langes schwert” (longsword ) – plates 1-67
review and identify similar dagger techniques as instructed previously in this
training program in the online section entitled “Degen (Dolch) (Dagger) plates 170 – 190”
review and identify similar grappling techniques as instructed earlier in this
training program in the online section entitled “Ringen (Wrestling) - plates
191 – 221”

3) Giacomo di Grassi – 1594
Although a later period master, di Grassi does make references to the importance of
footwork, timing and judgment. These are the “soft” skills that all martial artists must
develop. di Grassi discusses how one would obtain the necessary attributes to develop
skills in judgment (knowing when to strike without leaving an opening to be struck in
return, straight line attacks and timing). The student will need to consider the following
points:
i.
ii.

of paces – principles of harmony of footwork and hand
principles of the true art of defence – judgment, strength and activity –
falsing/deceit

4) George Silver – 1599
Although “George Silver spends a fair amount of time frothing at the mouth about the
folly of the newfangled Italian rapier play, as opposed to the English sword.”, he reveals
in an easy to read style, the classic principles of the true fight. He discusses the four
critical components of a true fight engagement that the fighter must internalize: four true
times, four false times, four grounds and the four governors. Of course, the utilization of
such concepts is dependent upon the engagement situation and the fighters involved.
For example, consider two swordsman engaged but out of range of each other. One
moves his hand in order to position his sword and then steps forward. He is using the
true time. The opponent however, steps forward first and then positions his sword. He is
using false time. This means that the user of the true time is now already prepared to
attack the opponent because the opponent’s sword would not as yet be in place due to his
using the false time.
Silver’s work is extremely important and the student should “nail” down the principles.
For convenience, a brief of summary of the principles follow.

The Four True Times
1. The time of the hand.
2. The time of the hand and body.
3. The time of the hand, body, and foot.
4. The time of the hand, body, and feet.
The true times refer in descending order the comparative speeds of movement of the
various parts of the body. The movement of the hand only is the fastest moving part
while the more complex movement that involves the hand, body and feet are slowest in
comparison.
The Four False Times
1. The time of the foot.
2. The time of the foot and body.
3. The time of the foot, body, and hand.
4. The time of the feet, body, and hand.
The false times are the inverse with respect to speed of the body parts. The fighter must
be aware that false times would create openings that the opponent will take advantage of.
“Thus have I thought good to separate and make known the true times from the false, with the
true wards thereto belonging, that thereby the rather in practicing of weapons a true course may
be taken for the avoiding of errors and evil customs, and speedy attaining of good habit or perfect
being in the true use and knowledge of all manner of weapons.” George Silver, 1599

The Four Grounds
1. Judgment
2. Distance
3. Time
4. Place
Within the context of the four grounds, judgment defines the ability to maintain the
optimum distance between yourself and the opponent. The optimum distance is to be
positioned such that you are out of striking range, however, you are close enough to take
advantage of any openings that may occur. Time is that defining moment when you can
safely attack your opponent without him being able to reciprocate. Place refers to the
opening in the opponent’s defence through which you can deliver your attack. Therefore,
through judgment, you keep your distance, through distance you get your time, through
time, you safely win the place in which to strike the opponent.6
The Four Governors
1. Judgment
2. Measure
6

The four grounds were originally written by Silver, however, Maestro Terry Brown
does an excellent interpretation in his book.

3. Pressing In
4. Flying Out
The first governor is judgment, which is to know when your adversary can reach you, and
when not, and when you can do the like to him, and to know by the goodness or badness
of his lying, what he can do, and when and how he can perform it. The second governor
is measure. Measure is the better to know how to make your space true to defend
yourself, or to offend your enemy. The third and forth governors are a twofold mind
when you press in on your enemy, for as you have a mind to go forward, so must you
have at that instant a mind to fly backward upon any action that shall be offered or done
by your adversary. 7 The student must consider the following points:
i.
ii.

the issues regarding the Italian masters
principles of the true fight, independent of weapons employed
timing of the true fight vs the false fight

5) Sigmund Ringeck – c1389 – 1440
Ringeck’s “Commentaries on Johannes Liechtenauer’s Fechtbuch” is included because
Maestro Liechtenauer is often considered the grandfather of fechtbuchs. A number of
fechtbuchs written since Liechtenauer’s day all demonstrate his influence. His
commentaries support the critical attributes of a good fighter, those being footwork and
tactics (judgment, distance, time, place). The following is a self-explanatory extraction
from Ringeck’s translated text. This text is available freely from a number of sources on
the internet.
Footwork
Note: This is the first tenet of the long sword: learn to strike blows equally well from
both sides if you want to learn to fence well.
Note: If you want to strike from the (your) right side, make sure, your left foot is forward
(at the beginning); if you want to strike from the left side, the right foot must be forward.
If you strike an oberhau from the right side then, follow the blow with your right foot.
If you do not the blow is wrong and ineffective, because your right side stays behind.
Because of this the blow will fall short and cannot travel in its proper arc towards the left
side. If you strike from the left side and you do not follow the blow, it too is wrong. That
is why no matter from which side you deliver the strike, follow the blow with the same
foot. So you will succeed in all techniques. This is how you shall strike all blows.

Tactical Basics
When you are closing to an opponent, do not watch his blows and do not wait for what he
might use against you. Because all fencers, who just wait for their opponents blows and
do not do anything else than warding them off, do not succeed very often. They are
defeated very often.
Note: Always fence using all of your strength! When you're close, strike at his head and
at his body, so he may not be able to change through (Durchwechseln) in front of your
point. After the blow, from the bind, strike light blows at his next opening, as is described
in the section about different blows and other techniques.
Note: This tenet is addressed to left-handers and right-handers. If you are a right-handed
fencer and you are closing to an opponent and you think you can hit him, do not strike the
first blow from the (your) left side. Because you are weak there and you cannot resist, if
he binds strongly against your blade. Because of this, strike from the right side, you can
work strongly "Am Schwert" ("on the sword") and you can use all techniques you like.
So, if you are left-handed, do not strike from the right side, since left-handers are usually
not used to strike effectively from the right side and vice versa.
Note: Above all other things, you must understand the principles of "before" (Vor) and
"after" (Nach), because the entire art of fencing is based upon it. "Before" means, preempting him with a blow or a thrust against an opening before he can hit you, so he must
defend/displace (Versetzen). So, be flexible in your defence and aim with your sword at
one opening after the other, so he cannot get through with his own techniques. But, if he
rushes in, start wrestling.
"After" means: If you do not succeed with the "before", wait for the "after". These are the
defenses against all techniques he uses against you. So, if you have to displace him, make
the displacement ‘simultaneously" (Indes) and from the bind, strike immediately at his
nearest opening. So you win the "before" and he remains in the "after". Also, you should
–during the "before" and "after" –notice ‘simultaneously" (Indes) how you can "work"
against the strong or the weak of his sword.
This means: The strong of the sword reaches from the cross guard to the middle of the
blade, with it, you can hold opposed, if somebody binds against it. The weak reaches
from the middle of the blade to the point. Here you cannot hold opposed. If you firmly
understand this, you can "work" and defend yourself very well.
Princes and Lords learn to survive with this art, in earnest and in play. But if you are
fearful, then you should not learn to fence. Because a despondent heart will always be
defeated, regardless of skill. 8

Book 1: Recruit Physical Training Program

This section introduces the students to the history of European medieval martial arts,
historical background on the evolution of the longsword, various stages of armour
development, and an introduction to the fundamentals of medieval swordsmanship. A
student entering the world of medieval martial arts will typically begin with the training
presented in this book and who will incur a duration of three (3) - six (6) months
depending upon commitment and time devoted to practice.

1.0 Grappling (abrazare ) Techniques
Introduction
The student is introduced to grappling or wrestling techniques (abrazare) as is called in
Fiore dei Liberi’s manuscript. The training begins with these wrestling techniques
because it forms the basis on which other skills are layered upon, such as dagger and
longsword techniques. The student is introduced to the techniques described in Liberi’s
“Flos Duellatorum” written in 1409/1410. It is critical that the student comprehend that
the techniques learned in this part and the later dagger part, are extremely dangerous
techniques! The student must remain cognizant that his/her partner is exactly that, a
training partner, and not someone to compete with during the training exercises. In
Liberi’s manuscript, there are very few instances (four instances we believe) in which he
refers to the partner as an “opponent”. The student will view his/her training partner in
the light of “scholler” (scholare – Italian, someone that has more experience than he/she)
or “players” (zugadore – Italian, a partner in training) or “companion” (compagno –
Italian, another reference to a partner in a non-aggressive orientation).
Complete medieval combat training does not only involve developing skill with the
sword. Other skills are necessary in order to develop high degree of swordsmanship
skills. In battle conditions, one must be comfortable and able to continue combat, handto-hand/grappling should one loose the sword, or if the opponent closes in on the student.
Following this section, the student is provided with basic skills in the area of closequarter combat with dagger techniques that leverage what was learned in this section.
The student at the end of this training part will have developed a good understanding and
some skill in the area of guards (positions in preparation to deploy defensive or offensive
maneuvers) and begin the development of timing, distance, judgment and position.
Advanced grappling and throw techniques as documented by the other masters will be
explored in later levels of training. The skills developed in this level of development
comprise the minimum technical requirements for the acquisition of the rank of scholler.

1.1 General Grappling Fundamentals
We begin this training with the four (4) fundamental grappling holds. These form the
basis on which more sophisticated knife and longsword disarming techniques will be
introduced in later skill levels training. These are forms to familiarize students with
fundamentals of fighting and are taught foremost as combat techniques. A short
description of each hold follows. The illustrations depict the holds from above in order to
provide a visual clarification of the holds described.
Another concept is the notion of the opponent's "inside" and "outside". His/her "inside"
is the area of the body to the left of the weapon wielding arm (assuming right
handedness) and his/her "outside" is the area of the body to the right of the weapon arm.

with this type of hold, you would be in a good position to deliver a hip-thrust throw

The following section describes 3 increasingly advanced levels of drills to designed to
develop the necessary grappling skills. The drills are not competition, and therefore, the
student and partner must be managed by an instructor or coach to ensure that the pair
don't get away from themselves.

1.1.5 Grappling Drills

Level #1
These training drills are to be conducted in pairs. This drill is designed to increase the
student's comfort with grappling his/her opponent. In order for this to occur, the
opponent must assume a non-resistant "living mannequin" role. In other words, the
student delivering the holds, will have free range and unrestricted ability to deliver the
above holds, in whatever sequence the student desires.
The student must transition between each of the holds described above, alternating
between left and right holds if relevant.
This should be done for about five (5) minutes for each student.

Level #2
This drill is similar to level #1, except the partner now presents some resistance to the
holds, making the holds a little more difficult. There should be no offense on the part of
the "living mannequin" role, only resistance.
This should be practiced for about five (5) minutes for each student.
Level #3
In this drill level, the pair is now working against each other, each trying to get the better
of the other, utilizing any one or more of the holds learned. Each attempts to work out of
the grips by the opponent, and also attempts to deliver a hold and secure control of the
opponent.
This should be practiced for at least five (5) minutes.
During this drill, some additional enhancements can be included:
• when using the neck & elbow hold, the one taking the initiative, should consider
pulling the opponent's head towards you in order to cause the opponent to
momentarily loose footing or cause an imbalance in the opponent
• when delivering either diagonal hold, or back or belt hold, using your hip, thrust your
hip under and then up against the opponent, using the leverage of your lower body
and legs to momentarily lift the opponent off the floor
• when in a hold position (you are on the defensive in this case), try to force your hands
through the hold from the inside giving you more leverage and provide you the
opportunity to deliver a hold on your opponent
1.1.6 Fundamental Throws
Continuing with the basics of unarmed combat training, we now utilize the holds learned
above and throw the opponent using either one of the pair of techniques described below.
These throws by no means should be considered a complete unarmed combat training
method. These have been introduced purely as a method of expanding one's longsword
training to include cross-training techniques and as a precursor to grappling and halfsword techniques introduced in scholler level of skill training.
Hip/Thigh Throw (L/R)
• position the feet approximately shoulder width apart, and face your opponent at a
distance apart that will allow you to place your hand on the back of your opponent's
neck without stretching
• place your left hand on the back of your opponent's neck (left hold)

1.2 Abrazare Techniques
1.2.1 Four Guards (quattro posta)
The student is introduced to the specifics of wrestling or abrazare and grappling as
described by Fiore dei Liberi. This covers the four fundamental guards that form the
basis of all skills developed in later units. In Liberi's manuscript, each section begins with
crowned masters (magistro) that illustrate the posta or stances. In addition to the masters
that introduce the fundamental postas in the beginning of each section, other masters are
included that introduce sub-sections. This will be evident in the later parts of this section.
All the illustrations in this section are extracts from Fiore dei Liberi's "Flos
Duellatorum", of the Novati Pissani edition.
v posta longa (long guard)
The long guard is deployed in preparation for a throw,
providing the foot placement is correct. The right arm
is extended outwards and upwards, the left hand
somewhat relaxed on the left side (ready to grab,
strike, etc.). The right leg is forward and the left leg is
trailing. The reverse is true with the extension of the
left artm. This guard will be illustrated later
demonstrating the capabilities of this guard position
with respect to throws.

v dente di zenchiar (boar’s tooth)
The boar's tooth illustrates the starting position of a
very volatile movement in which the right arm
begins with the elbow bent approx 900 (upper arm
parallel to the floor, the forearm perpendicular).
The left hand is relaxed on the left side in
preparation to grab or strike. Right leg is forward
and left leg trailing. The right arm would move
forcebly upwards, which is a fundamental move to
break a grip. Frequently, from the boar's tooth, one
would assume the long guard resulting in throwing
the opponent.

v porta di ferro (iron gate)
The iron gate illustrated depicts the master with both
hands positioned approximately waist height, palms
down, left leg forward and right leg trailing. The
weight is distributed over the left leg. This guard is
most often assumed at the end of the movement, i.e.
if the master grabs the opponent, forcing the
opponent to the ground by assuming the iron gate
guard or in preparation of a dagger attack.

v posta frontale (frontal guard)
The frontal guard is similar to the iron gate, in that
both hands are in a similar position and raised to
approximately the height of the shoulders. Right leg
is forward and left is trailing. It is with this position
that one would block an oncoming attack or grab the
opponent and move towards the iron gate to take your
opponent down.

patient’s left hip. The patient agent thrusts his
left hand forward to grip the elbow/upper right
arm of the agent, and deploy the boar’s tooth
(denti di zenchiar) with the right arm while
stepping through the hold – the patient agent
must not bend down or over while deploying
this hold.

1.3 Transitional Training
This “transitional unit” prepares the student for the next part of the training, that being
dagger or “daga”. The weapons used in this section are simple dowels. The point of this
transitional unit is to train the student in becoming comfortable with blocking and
parrying with a dowel, and to use the dowel as a grappling tool.
v iron gate (agent) è neck lock with dowel (counter)
The agent attempts to grab the patient agent’s
legs from an iron gate (porta di ferro) guard
position. The patient agent (wearing the band),
with the dowel strikes the agent behind the neck
with right hand and hooks the neck with the
dowel. Left hand grabs the other end of the
dowel resulting in a crossed-forearm grip on the
dowel. The patient agent resumes the iron gate
(porta di ferro).

v Shoulder grip (agent) è chin push and dowel hook on thigh (counter)
The agent attempts to grab the patient agent’s
shoulders and or neck. The patient agent using
the boar’s tooth with the left arm, comes up on
the inside of the agent’s right arm, and pushes
under the chin, pressing the thumb into the soft
tissue under the chin. At the same time, the
patient agent hooks the dowel on the agent’s left
thigh through his crotch, and using this hook,
lifts the agent’s leg with the hook in conjunction
with the chin push.

2.0 Dagger (daga) Techniques
Introduction
This part of the student’s guide will provide the student with the basics of dagger
techniques. These are the fundamental concepts that must be learned, on which all other
techniques and skills are based upon. This training is by no means complete with respect
to dagger techniques, however, basic skills in this area will enhance the overall
experience and skill of the student and position the student to challenge for the prize of
scholler. The purpose of this unit is to introduce the student to basic offensive and
defensive dagger techniques, all from the perspective of an underhand or sopramano grip
on the dagger (ice pick grip).
1) dagger attack è ward and strike
This basic exercise is designed to introduce the student to the notion of moving offline when under attack, and to develop a natural ability to ward off an attack with one
hand and use the other hand to attack at the same time rather than being idle.
v attack from above è ward to the inside
begin with the porta di ferro stance (left leg forward), re-direct attacking arm to
the outside with the left hand, move inside by stepping to the right with the right
foot (gathered step) - right hand prepared to strike or punch
v attack from above è ward to the outside
begin with the porta di ferro stance (left leg forward), re-direct attacking arm to
the inside with the right hand, move outside by moving the right foot forward and
to the left (passing step), rotate body clockwise and followed by left hand
prepared to strike or punch
2) dagger attack è ward and throw
This exercise takes the above basic one step further
by deploying a known guard, the posta longa in
order to take the opponent down. The student will
learn the importance of timing and footwork in
order to successfully deploy this ward and throw.
v attack from above è ward to the outside
begin with the porta di ferro stance (left leg
forward), re-direct attacking arm to the outside
with the left hand (in this case, actually grip
the wrist with thumb downwards) and push the
attacking arm upwards and towards the rear

step forward with the right foot (passing step) and position the foot behind the
attacker's right leg and simply deploy the long guard and take down the opponent
over your right leg (The illustration on the bottom right of the previous page is an
extract from Fiore dei Liberi's "Flos Duellatorum", 1410.
3) dagger attack è ward, disarm and strike
v attack from above è forearm grip
and twist and disarm
the attack is met with a grip to the
agent's forearm with the patient
agent's left hand (thumb
downward) just shy of the agent's
wrist. The patient agent then
immediately twists the agent's
forearm towards the left, pressing
the patient agent's inside forearm
against the agent's blade.
Continuing with the twisting of
the agent's forearm, and the blade
pressed against the patient agent's
forearm, the agent will release the
dagger
v attack from above è grip wrist and elbow, arm bent upward at elbow and disarm
the attack is met with a grip to the agent's forearm with the patient agent's left
hand (thumb downward) and is immediately forced back and upwards. At the
same time, the patient agent will grasp the agent's elbow from underneath and left
the elbow with the right hand while the left hand is now forcing the agent's upper
forearm back and downwards. This will cause the agent to loose balance, or
provide the opportunity to manually disarm the agent.

3.0 Longsword (spada longa) Techniques
3.1 Footwork
A critical component of fight skills is footwork. A pair of notable masters explicitly
documented their thoughts surrounding this aspect of the fight. George Silver stated:
"Of running and standing safe in rapier fight, the runner has the advantage."
followed by
"If two valiant men fight being both cunning in running, & that they both use the same at
one instant, their course is doubled, the place is won of both sides, and one or both of
them will commonly be slain or sore hurt. And if one of them shall run, and the other
stand fast upon the imbrocata11 or stocata12 , or however, the place will be at one instant
won of one side, and gained of the other, and one or both of them will be hurt or slain. If
both shall press hard upon the guard, he that first thrusts home in true place, hurts the
other, & if both thrust together, they are both hurt. Yet some advantage the runner has,
because he is an uncertain mark, and in his motion. The other is a certain mark, and in
dead motion, And by reason of this many times the unskillful man takes advantage he
knows not how, against him that lies watching upon his ward or stocata guard."
George Silver, 1599

Di Grassi's words are also important. He stated:
"As concerning the motion of the feet, from which grow
great occasions as well of offense as Defense, I say and have
seen by diverse examples that as by the knowledge of their
orderly and discreet motion, as well in the Lists as in
common frays, there has been obtained honorable victory, so
their busy and unruly motion have been occasion of
shameful hurts and spoils. And because I cannot lay down a
certain measure of motion, considering the difference
between man and man, some being of great and some of
little stature: for to some it is commodious to make his pace
the length of an arm, and to other some half the length or
more. Therefore I advertise every man in all his wards to
frame a reasonable pace, in such sort that if he would step
forward to strike, he lengthen or increase one foot, and if he
would defend himself, he withdraw as much, without peril of falling…."

followed by
"It is to be known that the feet move either straightly, either circularly: If straightly, then either
forwards or backwards: but when they move directly forwards, they frame either a half or a
whole pace. By whole pace is understood, when the foot is carried from behind forwards, keeping
steadfast the forefoot. And this pace is sometimes made straight, sometimes crooked. By straight
is meant when it is done in a straight line, but this does seldom happen. By crooked or slope pace
is understood, when the hindfoot is brought also forwards, but yet a thwart or crossing: and as it
goes forwards, it carries the body with it, out of the straight line, where the blow is given. In this
unit, the student will focus almost entirely on developing good footwork and will be introduced to
additional individual-oriented sword handling drills."

Giacomo Di Grassi, 1594
1) Basic Footwork & Stance
The student must understand that good footwork is fundamental for both offensive and
defensive maneuvers. In other words, from well placed and firm footwork will spring all
offensive strikes, lunges, as well as thrusts and defensive evasion and redirection. The
following describe the fundamental principles of footwork the student must consider.
1. Proper and stable stance, foot
placement
The illustration on the left depicts the stance that
the student assumes. The stance on the far left
illustrates the most appropriate foot placement for
longsword. The ability to move in any direction is
represented by the arrow. One can move in any
direction with equal ability, agility and speed. The
feet are approximately shoulder width apart (the
stance assumes right-handedness). The width of
the feet will vary depending upon the physical
attributes of the individual. The stance is
relatively relaxed with the individual standing
erect and the weight is centred across the feet.
Balance is critical, especially when one is wearing armour which can increase the weight
by up to 60 lbs. The trailing foot is roughly 450 turned out with the heel approximately
positioned on the body's centre (as depicted by the vertical dotted line). The right foot is
forward, with toes oriented towards the opponent. The foot is to the right of the body's
centre line as illustrated. Knees are slightly bent with the shoulders approximately 600
square with respect to the opponent. This will provide greater freedom and opportunity
to attack and parry, despite presenting a larger "target" to the opponent. The stance of the
right in the above figure depicts the typical stance of a modern fencer. The primary
motion is much more linear and is focused on forward and backward movement. It is
included for comparison purposes only.

2. Passing (pass) step
Executing the forward pass is the most innate of human movements, i.e. the walk. The
trailing foot moves ahead of the forward foot in conjunction with
shifting weight and balance. A similar action occurs with the
reverse pass or retreat, however, the lead foot which is moving
backward will do so in a slight circular motion towards the rear.
The illustration on the left depicts the starting stance and the
resulting stance after a forward pass. The trailing foot, which
was the leading foot now assumes a 450 angle outwards, and the
leading foot now is oriented towards the opponent. The pass,
although natural phenomena, is conducted by shifting the weight
forward to the leading foot such that the weight of the body is
now centred on the leading foot, more specifically, the ball of the
leading foot. The trailing foot lifts up and is brought forward
passing the leading foot. Once the trailing foot, which is now the
leading foot, the weight centre now shifts to a normal distribution
between leading and trailing feet.
3. Gathered step
The gathered step is used primarily for the adjustment of range in an engagement while
maintaining the foot orientation or stance. This form of step
provides the opportunity to adjust range and to remain in an
optimum stance with which to deliver a strong strike supported by a
passing step with the right foot moving forward from the rear to the
front. At all times, while gathering forward or reverse, to keep the
body erect, knees slightly bent and centred. Do not lean to far
forward or reverse.
The illustration on the left depicts one of two schools of thought
with respect to gathered steps. The first is known as the "commited
gathered". In order to execute this gathered step, one would shift
the weight towards to the rear foot. The forward gather is executed
by taking the leading foot, moving forward and then placing it
down heel first followed by a shift of the weight forward. This will
take the weight away from the trailing foot which can now be
brought forward the same distance. The illustration depicts the
starting stance at the bottom, the transitional stance in the middle
ellipse followed by the final stance in above.
The reverse gathered is executed in a similar manner except the
trailing foot is first to move towards the rear followed by the
leading foot. Weight distribution is the reverse of the forward
gathered. One should not drag the trailing foot or lift it too high
Copyright  2001 A.E.M.M.A.

66

6/26/01

The Art of Longsword Combat – Book #1

NOT FOR RE-SALE

because this would introduce impact on the balance and provide an offensive opportunity
for the opponent.
The second school of thought is commonly known as the "noncommitted gathered". The observation with this form of step is that
while armoured, adjustment of range and the shifting of weight
forward results in greater effort should one decide to "cancel" the
forward gather by shifting the greater weight from the leading foot
backwards to return the leading foot to the normal stance. Therefore,
observation and application of this form of gathered step indicates far
greater ability to either completely execute the forward/reverse
gathered step or to cancel the gathered step. Cancellation of a
gathered step is due to some movement or intent of the opponent
resulting in one changing his/her mind with respect to adjusting
range. Therefore, as illustrated on the left, a forward non-commited
gather is executed by lifting the trailing foot and moving it forward
to just behind the leading foot. At this point, the weight is equally
distributed across both feet. It is at this point, that the individual can
easily commit to completely executing the forward gather by moving
the leading foot forward to assume the normal stance, or simply
return the leading foot back to its starting position. Very little effort
is required, and the shifting of weight becomes minimal, which is
very beneficial during armoured engagements.
4. Traverse (slope step)
A traverse (pronounced "trah" - "ver" - "say") is essentially a side step, whether lateral or
angled. It is executed to re-position one off-line from the
opponent resulting in a pair of individuals moving in a
circular motion around each other, each seeking
opportunities to attack. In general, the traverse is
executed on the pass, which is the dominant form of
footwork with the longsword.

2

The execution of the traverse, using the illustration on the
left, is a pass done by moving the trailing foot forward
and to the left. The weight again is shifted slightly
forward to the leading foot. Once the trailing foot is
1
planted, the weight shifts again slightly to the now new
leading foot and move the right foot forward to assume
the leading foot position again. The movement is
typically initiated with the trailing foot so as to conceal
the intent from the opponent. Assuming a similar starting
stance as illustrated, and the traverse is towards the right, in this case, the leading foot
would initiate the execution, followed by bringing up the trailing foot. This is a gathered
traverse.

In order to deliver a mechanically sound strike, it is important to deliver a strike from the
right by stepping with the right forward, however, it is important to be able to deliver a
strike from the left.
“That is why, no matter from which side you are striking, follow the blow with the same foot. So
you will succeed in all techniques. This how you shall strike all blows.”

3.2 Introduction to Strikes and Guards
There are eight simple lines of attack (nine if you include the thrust). The strikes
encompass the horizontal, vertical, diagonal and which can be delivered from the left to
right and right to left. The most versatile of these are the diagonal strikes, followed by the
horizontal with the vertical strikes being the least used (due to it being the most easily
defended of strikes). The figure below depicts the angles and their classic Italian names
with English subscripts. Standard nomenclature for the strikes has not stabilized to date,
therefore, the names provided and used in this manual are based on the most common
names that are used in the historical fencing community.

Figure 8 Strike Angles
Fiore dei Liberi simplified the strikes even further by naming all downward strikes as
"fendente". The upward diagonal strikes were called "colpi sottani" and the horizontal
strikes "colpi mezani". Liberi did not consider the vertical downward strike in his

manuscript, claiming that it shouldn't be used because it is easily defended against.
However, this manual does include the downward vertical strike or "fendente" as well as
the upward vertical strike or "montante". These are terms used by other Italian masters
and it was felt that these particular strikes do have a place in both attack and defence
situations.
The last strike is the thrust, referred to as "le punta" by Liberi. In his treatise, thrusts are
delivered with both hands on the hilt. However, other masters have documented
delivering thrusts with a single hand. Most notably is Giacomo di Grassi. He writes (with
respect to two-handed swords):
"The thrust is discharged (as soon as the enemy's sword is found) as far in the beginning
as he may with both arms: Then, taking away the cross hand, he shall force it farther on
with the pommel hand, as much as he may stretch it forth, always in the discharge,
increasing a slope pace. And the thrust being thus delivered, he shall presently retire his
said pace, and return his hand again to the cross, settling himself either in the high or
low warde."
Giacomo di Grassi, "His True Arte of Defense", 1594

Liberi depicts armoured fighting in his manuscript, but does not illustrate strikes/cuts
delivered by the opponent, but rather thrusts. It is evident from his manuscript that there
are no thrusts made to the armpit and that thrusts are confined to the face from the front,
or to the unarmoured areas of the opponent's back. The armoured techniques rely on
grappling, throws and half-sword techniques. This level of training does not include
thrusting but the concept and opportunities for thrusting are covered. Thrusting is
included as a later part of training when the student has achieved his/'her scholler rank.
3.3 The Guards (Posta)
Guards or stances are positions from which the swordsman can deliver an attack or
defend oneself, often times with a combination of both. Guards should not be considered
static positions. There are a number of guard positions, and each possesses its strength
and weaknesses. It is up to the swordsman through training and skill to determine the
appropriate guard position for the situation. The swordsman must also be able to flow
from one guard position to another during the course of a fight.
Some of the sources have categorized the guards into two groups, the primary guards and
the secondary guards. Given that this book's primary source is Liberi's treatise, these are
not categorized and are simply listed and described in detail. The guards are very similar
to those employed with other weapons such as the single sword, sword & shield and even
the quarterstaff. Each guard can be deployed as a right or left position. The student
should be comfortable with each symmetrical stance. Assuming right-handedness, the
stance would be structured with the student's right leg forward, assuming a forward
stance; a left leg lead is referred to as the reverse stance.

3.3.1 High Guard
Italian:
Fiore dei Liberi: posta frontale (frontal guard/crown guard)
Vadi: posta di falcone (guard of the hawk)
Giacomo Di Grassi: della guardia alta (the high ward)
German:
Hans Talhoffer: oberhieb (over cut)
One will not find this guard in Liberi's treatise, however a variation of this guard is
identified in the treatise as the "posta frontale". The sword is held above the head, with
the blade pointing upwards and
behind at approximately 450 to
the ground (for the posta
frontale, the sword is held
approximately vertically, with
the hilt in approximately the
same position as the high guard).
The pommel should be
positioned forward to the
forehead, and the guard above
the forehead. From this
position, one can deliver one of
the most powerful centre cuts, or
fendente13 or other offensive
deliveries such as the tondo14 or
sgualembrato15 . This position
Figure 9 high guard
allows one to exploit the energy of the sword on its
downward motion to its target.
It is not important which leg is leading when the
offensive strike is delivered. The objective is to utilize
the energy of the sword and focus this at the moment of
contact with the opponent. This guard exposes the torso
to potential attack (or invites the opportunity), however,
this guard can deliver one of the most powerful
downward strikes to eliminate the enemy.
The figure on the right is an extract from Hans
Talhoffer's "Fechtbuch aus dem Jahre 1467"
manuscript, tafel #1, entitled "oberhieb". It clearly
illustrates the high guard stance. Notice the grip is
somewhat spaced, whereby the left hand is grasping a portion of the pommel.

3.3.2 Middle Guard
Italian:
Fiore de’ Liberi: posta breve (short guard)
Camillo Agrippa: la terza guardia (the third guard)
German:
Hans Talhoffer: pflug16 (guard of the plow)
The sword is held with the blade pointing upwards and ahead at approximately 450 to the
ground such that the tip of the blade is pointing towards the hollow at the base of the
opponent’s throat. The reason for this is to enhance the concealment of the true
dimensions of the sword. In other words, from the opponent’s perspective, he will see a
very small cross-section of the sword because of its angle, and will unable to determine
the sword’s exact length, thus giving you the advantage on the strike. The pommel
should be positioned forward to

Figure 10 middle guard
the lower abdomen. The grip is fairly relaxed but firm. This position is probably the
most natural position, and is also the position from which most parries and offensive
strikes can be made from. This also enables a fairly fluid
engagement with the opponent to allow one to identify
the most opportune moment to strike.
It is not important which leg is leading when the offensive
strike is delivered. It is important to note that when a
strike from the right is delivered and the left leg is
forward, that the reach will not be as great as when one
has the right leg forward. However, during battle, having
the feet positioned optimally is difficult at best. For this
reason, the training program drills will re-enforce the
ability to deliver strikes from the right and left with
varying foot positions to ensure one is comfortable and confident with strikes from any
foot position. The figure above and on the right is an extract from Fiore dei Liberi's
"Flos Duellatorum" and illustrates the posta breve stance.
16

pflug – the German structure is similar to Liberi’s, except the guard is not carried in the middle, but
rather positioning the hilt against the side of the hip, point oriented towards the opponent.

3.3.3 Low Guard
Italian:
Fiore de’ Liberi: porta di ferro (Iron Gate)
Fiore de’ Liberi: denti di cinghiale (Tooth of the Boar)
Giacomo DiGrassi: della guardia bassa (The Low Ward)
Achille Marozzo: guardia di cinghiara porta di ferro larga (Guard of the
large iron gate of the wild boar)
German:
Hans Talhoffer: alber (fool's guard)
The low guard can be both a defensive and offensive posture. It can parry strikes to any
part of the body, such as the legs, thighs, shoulder, head and it can be used to deflect
aside the opponent's sword followed by a thrust or simply a position from which a thrust
can be delivered. This guard position has the advantage of “inviting” an attack from the
opponent from which one can quickly deliver a counter with either an upward

Figure 11 low guard
cut, thrust, re-direct or reposition to a hanging guard (see next section for description on
the hanging guard). The low guard is also effective in
maintaining “distance” between oneself and the opponent.
During the engagement, one can quickly change from the
low guard to the middle guard, long guard or hanging guard
depending upon the situation. Leg positioning (forward
stance vs reverse stance) will determine the “length” of the
offensive strike in terms of reach, especially from a thrust
perspective.
It is important to understand, that when shifting from the
low guard to another guard, the point of the blade must
always point towards the opponent, and that the motion of
the point be minimum. Much of the motion will focus in
the hilt area and the blade will follow. The blade must also move in more straight-lined
motions rather than arcs when changing from the low guard to another guard position.
The figure above and on the right is an extract from Fiore dei Liberi's "Flos
Duellatorum" and illustrates the porta di ferro mezzana stance.

Variations of the low guard:
The following describes the variations of the low guard as described by Liberi. It is
interesting to note that Liberi doesn't really employ the low guard to defend leg attacks,
given that the defense of low strikes to the legs is deployed by placing distance between
the offensive strike and the leg. This opens up the opportunity to respond to the attack
with an offensive maneuver from the low guard, that typically being swiping the
attacking sword aside, and deliver either a cutting strike or thrust. The opportunity for
such a response is present because when one delivers a low cut to the legs, the agent
exposes the upper part of his/her body to attack, and the fact that the upper body is
actually closer to the patient agent, an offensive response by the patient agent is
imminent.
Half Iron Gate (porta di ferro mezana)
The sword is held with the point downwards and
forward and slightly outwards and to the left
(similar to holding a hockey stick), with the right
foot forward - toes pointing to the opponent, the left
foot trailing (reverse stance). From this position,
one would parry aside the oncoming strike with the
false edge followed by a thrust. This would occur in
conjunction with the left foot moving forward and
out to the left (traverse). Liberi describes this guard
as "stabile" meaning turning without moving the
feet. The motion is such that the right leg acts
somewhat as a "hinge" for the gate and as the body
rotates on the right leg, the upper body assumes a
position that is off-line with the opponent's strike and a thrust is delivered from an
orientation that is off-line of the initial engagement. The tail guard is simply the reverse
of this stance.
Full Iron Gate (tutta porta di ferro)
The sword is held with the point downwards and outwards (think
of scribing a triangle, 2 points with the feet, the 3rd with the tip of
the sword), left foot forward, right foot back (forward stance).
From this position, one would parry aside the oncoming strike
followed by a thrust as the half-iron gate. However, this guard is
delivered in conjunction with the right foot moving forward with
a passing step. The motion is such that the left leg acts as a
"hinge" for the gate, as the sword moves from the right to the left
positioned in order to parry aside the strike with the true edge,
and the passing step enables one to close the gap even further to
deliver a thrust with greater reach with both hands on the grip
and the arms extended. The movement remains on-line with the

initial engagement. The sword starting in this position will possess greater power for the
parry due to its being "chambered" further back.
Half Boar's Tooth (denti di cinghiale mezana)
The sword is held with the point downwards and oriented
towards the opponent. The right leg is extended and
forward, and the left leg is trailing. The weight is
distributed mostly onto the left leg. This position is very
similar to the porta di ferro mezana, except for the weight
distribution and the sword is pulled back and is chambered
higher up towards the waist. The execution involves
raising the sword upwards striking aside the oncoming
blow, in conjunction with a traverse with the left foot
forward and outwards to the left taking the body off-line
from the attacking blow. Once the false-edge has made
contact with and struck aside the oncoming blow, the
finishing move is to deliver a downward strike with the
true edge, finding a target such as the opponent's extended
forearms or the head.
Full Boar's Tooth (tutta denti di cinghiale)
The stance assumed is very similar to the half iron gate
(posta di ferro mezana) except for the following
differences: the point of the sword is situated behind the
forward foot rather than in front of it; the sword is
chambered even higher up on the left hip to provide greater
power in the upward parry (with the false edge) to parry
aside the attacking blow, and complete with a powerful
downward strike with the true edge. The foot movement is
similar to the half boar's tooth, except the left foot is moved
forward and outward to the left (traverse), and the body
pivots on the right foot.

An observation of these two stances is that they are the reverse of each other. For
example, assume the full boar's tooth stance, while maintaining the orientation of the
sword, simply turn the head and body so that you would face an opponent directly behind
you. By virtue of the sword position and the rotating of the body and head, you would
assume the half boar's tooth guard stance.

3.3.4 Hanging Guard
Italian:
Fiore de’ Liberi: Posta di donna (guard of woman)
German:
Hans Talhoffer: Hangenort (hanging guard)
The hanging guard refers to a number of variations of guards as described by Liberi and
Talhoffer. Both masters do not refer to this guard as a hanging guard. It is possible that
the first reference to the term hanging guard appeared in Zachary Wylde in 1711
whereby he references the hanging guard as being the same as Silver's "true guardant
ward", and the
guardant ward
(Silver) describes
what appears to be
the guard of the
woman. It is
considered one of the
most versatile guards
and can be deployed
to parry strikes
against the head and
upper body,
Figure 12 hanging guard
horizontal cuts to the head, body and it can also be quickly lowered to parry against
blows to the lower parts of the body. The direction of the blade is such that it is
somewhat extended over the leading leg and the point
towards the opponent. Therefore, should the left leg be in
the lead, the arms and hilt is positioned on the right side of
the head, with the blade positioned forward and over the
left leg, and the hands will be crossed (crossed hanging
guard). When the right leg is the lead leg, the same
position is obtained, except in reverse as for the left lead
leg and the hands are not crossed (true hanging guard).
Most of the speed of the parry will occur around the hilt
area. One can drop quickly to the low guard, in which most
of the motion is centered on the hilt and hands. A variation
of the hanging guard is described later. The figure on the right depicts a true hanging
guard from Hans Talhoffer's "Fechtbuch aus dem Jahre 1467" - tafel #13.
The execution of this guard must be done with care, so as to not cover the face and
restrict one’s vision. From this position, one can deliver an offensive strike, such as the
squalembrato by rotating the sword on the right hand and deliver the strike to the
opponent’s left side of the head/neck (assuming the lead leg was the left to start with).
This delivery will require very little energy and is a very quick offensive strike. This
guard can also be used to deliver a thrusting strike against the opponent. One would step
into the opponent, rotate the arms and thrust forward with the point.

Guard of the Window
Italian:
Fiore dei Liberi: posta de finestra
German:
Hans Talhoffer: Ochs (ox guard)
Liberi implies that this particular guard is quite universal in its applications. The position
of the sword, with point directed towards the opponent and combined with the hand
placement makes for a very flexible and viable guard position. Should the cut be high,
simply raise the guard. If the cut is low, simply drop the guard, or at least the point to

Figure 13 guard of the window
parry the cut. One may even achieve the tutta porta di ferro or full iron gate. This guard
can be deployed from any other guard stance. The sword is raised to approximately
forehead height, and the hilt assembly is positioned in
front of the head and behind it, so that the forte of the
blade passes in front of the forehead, giving the
appearance of one peering out a window from below the
sash. The blade is held relatively horizontal to the floor.
Most of the kinetic energy of the opponent's strike is redirected with the relaxed guard of the window. The redirection is done with the flat of the sword, and not the
edge. The edge defense will cause the swords to bind
rather then deflect. It is possible that you will be struck
with your own sword, on the flat as it receives the energy
of the strike, however, wearing armour will protect you
from injury. The primary difference between this and the
previous hanging guard, is that the weight is distributed on the rear leg (with respect to
the opponent) as opposed to the leading leg. The guard of the window is the reverse
stance of the guard of the woman (assuming similar sword orientation).
The illustration above and on the left is an extract from Fiore dei Liberi's "Flos
Duellatorum" 1410" depicting the posta de fenestra.

Guard of the Woman
Italian:
Fiore de’ Liberi: posta di donna
This guard is a variation of the hanging guard as described by Liberi. Liberi illustrates
two variations of the posta di donna. The first variation, the sword is almost entirely
concealed by the body by positioning it
downwards down the back of the
wielder. The guard is structured such
that the left foot is forward with toes
pointing towards the opponent and the
left foot trailing. The weight is
distributed towards the trailing leg. The
second variation as described by Liberi,
is very similar to the earlier variation in
with respect to body posture and
orientation, except the sword is more
horizontal in orientation and is behind
the head. The weight again is
distributed towards the rear leg.
Figure 14 guard of the woman
The sword is held essentially as one would hold a baseball bat. The critical property of
this guard is foot work. Assuming a middle guard with a
forward stance (right foot forward) as a start, the guard of
the woman is deployed by moving the right foot forwards
and to the left, essentially presenting to the opponent your
back. At the same time with this step (traverse), raise the
hilt and suspend the sword from
the right shoulder such that the
blade is roughly parallel with
the spine. The desired position
in the end is to achieve a
position off-line from the initial
engagement, parry the strike
(typically a horizontal strike)
and reposte with a strike to the opponent given his/her
side/back is now more exposed. We have interpreted that
the name "guard of the woman" appears to have been
applied to this stance given the wielder would overlook
his/her shoulder coyly looking at the opponent can be
perceived as a woman's look?
A very similar stance can be found in Liberi's treatise, which is illustrated opposite to the
guard of the window (Getty's version). The only difference between the two illustrations
is that the sword is behind the head rather than in front. Liberi identifies this guard as a
"posta di donna la fenestra pulsatima".

3.3.5 Long Guard
Italian:
Fiore de’ Liberi: Posta lunga (long guard)
Achille Marozzo: Guardia de facia (guard of the face)
German:
Hans Talhoffer: Der lange Zornort (long guard of wrath)
The sword is roughly parallel to the ground, and slightly below shoulder height. The
pommel should be positioned forward of the “solar plexus”. This position helps to
maintain “distance” between yourself and your opponent. It is not difficult to migrate to

Figure 15 long guard
an alternative primary guard from this position. It has been thought that this particular
guard from was designed to provide a good basis for thrust deliveries, however, it is also
believed that this guard is relatively static, and is primarily
used to keep your opponent at a distance, and provide the
opportunity to “study” the opponent from a safe distance.
Thirdly, it appears to be the most formidable guard stance
to deploy when facing an opponent who has deployed the
guard of the half iron gate. The figure on right from Fiore
dei Liberi's "Flos Duellatorum", 1410 depicting the posta
longa.
It is not critical with which leg to lead and which to trail.
This particular guard will not be stationary with respect to the opponent, because part of
the “study” includes footwork, to circle around your opponent in order to properly gauge
his/her strengths and weaknesses. It is also critical to remember to keep the point of the
sword positioned towards the face of your opponent in order to conceal the true length of
your weapon. The opponent seeing the sword point-on will find it difficult to determine
the length, and may even move in closer assuming the sword is shorter than it is.

3.3.6 Tail Guard
Italian:
Fiore de’ Liberi: Posta di coda lunga e distesa (Guard of Long and
Stretched out Tail)
German:
Hans Talhoffer: Nebenhut (near guard)
The purpose of this guard is to provoke an attack by presenting to the opponent an open
shoulder, while positioning the sword beside and behind. This under-stated guard can be
used to not only conceal the weapon from your opponent, but can also deliver a surprise
strong upward cut with a forward pass of the rear leg, swing out and thrust, lift from
behind and deliver a downward strike, etc. This position allows a number of opportunities
for alternative guard positions, including assuming a middle guard position by simply
arching the sword from the rear and upward and over until the middle guard is achieved.
A right stance is the only stance that makes sense if you are right handed (left leg
forward)

Figure 16 tail guard
The grip of the right hand (if you are right-handed) is the same grip applied when in a
middle guard position. The wrist is mildly hyperextended. It is not important which leg is leading, only
that for whichever leg is trailing, that is the side in which
the rear guard position is assumed, such that the trailing
leg is protected by the sword. A similar observation
made with respect to the boar's tooth, is that the tail
guard is the reverse stance of the porta di ferro mezzana.
The figure on the left is an extract from Fiore dei
Liberi's "Flos Duellatorum", labeled as the "posta di
coda lunga e distesa". Similar figures depicting this
guard can be found in Talhoffer's fechtbuch.

3.3.7 Two-horned Guard
Italian:
Fiori de’ Liberi: posta di bicorno
The two-horned guard is the starting position to deliver a thrusting strike to the opponent
while stepping in or charging in with your delivery. The delivery of the thrust with the
charging body behind it with the left palm pressed against the back of the pommel
enhances the power of the thrust and may be able to penetrate mail.

Figure 17 two-horned guard
The wielder of this guard must also be cognizant that the opponent will become fully
aware of the manner in which the next potential strike will take, given the grip. The hilt
is brought upwards, situated in front of the upper
chest with pommel close to the chest. The left
hand grips the pommel such that the forearm is
slightly rotated counter-clockwise whereby the
fingers wrap the pommel from the left, the palm
facing upwards and opened towards the right.
This places the left hand in an excellent position
to migrate to the end of the pommel during the
thrust such that in the end, the palm is used to
push the pommel forward into the thrust. The
thrust can be made at the mid-section of the
opponent as is illustrated above. A similar stance
can be used to deliver a thrust to the lower body
and a higher stance to deliver the same thrust at
the upper body and head. The typical defensive form is to sweep the sword to the left or
right, depending upon the positioning of the thrust. Using the middle guard or similar to
block against this thrust.
The figure on the above-left is from Fiore dei Liberi's "Flos Duellatorum" manuscript
and the illustration is labeled as "posta di bicorno".

3.4.1 Downward Vertical Strike
Italian:
Vadi/Marozzo: fendente
German:
Hans Talhoffer: oberhau/oberhieb (cut from overhead)
1. assume the middle guard stance (as illustrated in the figure below), with left foot
forward, right foot trailing, grasp the grip with your right hand and pommel with your
left hand, raise the sword up (the left hand doing the “work”) and overhead (ensuring
the point of the blade does not extend behind the head), and with a firm and resolute
motion, slice the sword downward to approximately 2 o’clock with respect to the
floor, apply pressure to the downward thrust through the hilt, as if you were to also
strike your opponent with the hilt
2. at the same time, take a large step forward with your back leg (in this case, your
right), knee bent at the termination of the cut, left leg behind you
3. when you reached this position, remain in that position momentarily and then return
to the middle guard stance

Figure 18 downward vertical strike
Note: In the above figure, both right and left hands grasp the grip to enhance the power of
the downward cut. The following are variation of the same strike.
(Note: This and other strikes will require control of the weapon. It is not a simple matter
of hammering down the sword, but rather deliver the strike on target with efficiency and
effectiveness. Any movement of the sword must be able to be stopped quickly in order for
you to change strategy, direction or execution of the form. For example, on a powerful
downward cutting movement, you must be able to quickly stop the momentum of the
sword at any moment, otherwise, if your intended target moves aside, your sword will

happily bury itself into the earth or log, and you as the warrior will not survive the

Variation of the downward vertical cut
•

the execution of the downward strike is deployed with alternating right leg
forward and then left leg forward (the point being that in an engagement, often
you are not in the most appropriate stance to deliver a fendente while stepping
forward with your right foot, and therefore, this practice ensures that you are able
to deliver the fendente, regardless of footwork.)

Alternative starting guards for the downward vertical strike
It is important that the student become familiar and comfortable with delivering the
downward vertical strike from any of the guards. When delivering the downward vertical
strike, the movement will transition though the high guard position. The following notes
describe certain specific elements of delivering a downward cut from a variety of
alternative guard.
High Guard
When delivering from this position, it is important to ensure that the sword
does not begin from an angle that is less than 45o to the horizontal. If the
sword is too far back, it will take a greater amount of energy to return the
sword to its highest position (the high guard) and will take more time to
deliver the strike leaving yourself open to attack. The high guard position
offers the best position for initiating this strike and you would use gravity
to assist the downward strike. You would practice this with taking a
passing step forward with the right, and with a passing step with the left.
Low Guard
This guard position is deceptive in that one can deliver a vertical strike
very quickly and effectively. Two manners of delivery are possible, a)
drop the point pull it you’re your side while rotating the hilt counter
clockwise. At the conclusion, you assume very closely, the guard of the
woman and from there transition through the high guard to deliver the
vertical strike; b) simply raise the sword and assume the high guard
stance and with a passing step forward, deliver the strike.
Hanging Guard
The "secret" when delivering the downward vertical strike from the
hanging guard position is to maintain the point of the blade pointing in the
direction of the opponent until the high guard position is achieved. This
will ensure that while you are "cocking" yourself to deliver a downward
cut, the opponent is kept at "bay" and thus, reduce the chance of receiving
a strike.
Tail Guard
A most deceitful and treacherous guard to begin with when considering
deploying a downward vertical strike. Two manners of deployment: a) raise
your grip upward and behind your shoulder transitioning through a guard
of the woman, and finally pass through the high guard and deliver the
strike; b) step forward while swinging forward and from the side and raise
to the high guard and deliver the downward strike.

3.4.2: Oblique Downward Strike
Italian:
Fiore de’ Liberi: sgualembrato (angled from above)
German:
Hans Talhoffer: oberhau/oberhieb
(Note: These strikes are intended to exploit any weakness in the armour of the opponent
by targeting arming points or arming straps. If this fails, the collar bone would be the
target. Part of the basic areas for attack, is 45 degrees on either side of the head, against
the shoulder. Liberi refers to these downward strikes as "fendente".)
1. from the middle guard stance as illustrated below, raise the sword overhead
2. while you are doing this, begin to move your right leg forward to prepare to “plant’ it
forward
3. when you have achieved the highest “potential” of the sword position, with force,
invoke a downward cut at 45 degrees from the vertical towards the shoulder of your
opponent
4. simultaneously take a step forward with your right leg to add power to your
downward strike
5. ensure that you transition from a downward vertical cut (from a high guard starting
point) to the oblique downward strike to deliver mis-information to the opponent (the
opponent will prepare for a downward strike, and quite possibly deploy the incorrect
defence)

Note: The figure on the bottom of the previous page illustrates the movements involved in
the oblique downward strike or sgualembrato. Note that from the front, the blade is
approximately 45o from the vertical, ending at the junction of the neck and shoulder of
your opponent.
Variations of this form include sgualembrato manco for those left-handed individuals,
sgualembrato dritto, in which only the right hand is used for the execution of this
variation. A brief explanation of each follows.
Variations of the Oblique Downward Strike

1. from middle guard position, raise the sword overhead to assume the high guard
stance
2. when you begin the trajectory, slide the pommel hand (left hand) up the grip to meet
the right hand to reduce the "crossing over" of the wrists during the delivery
3. when you have achieved the highest “potential” of the sword position, with force,
invoke a downward cut at 45 degrees from the vertical towards the shoulder of your
opponent
4. using your right hand after raising the sword, pivot the sword around your left wrist
5. simultaneously take a step forward with your left leg to add power to your downward
strike

3.4.3: Horizontal Strike
Italian:
Fiore de’ Liberi: tondo/traversi (from the side)
German:
Hans Talhoffer: mittelhau (horizontal cut)
(Note: Control of sword movement is critical to ensure that you do not get into trouble
by placing yourself into a disadvantageous position. This movement focuses on cutting
your opponent coming out from your right side, right hand applying the power. A large,
arched motion of the blade swinging from your side towards the opponent is achieved
when complemented by taking a step forward. This strike must be executed with great
resolve)
1. starting from the middle guard position, raise the sword and assume the high guard
stance
2. at the same time as you take a step forward with your sword leg (right leg if you are
executing this with your right hand), deliver the "impression" of a downward vertical
strike (feint), drop the point behind you and swing the sword outwards from the right
and strike horizontally
3. return the blade to the middle guard position

Figure 21 the horizontal strike
Note: The sword is swung out from your right side (assuming you are right handed),
relatively parallel to the floor, and ends directly in front of you with your arms nearly
extended. You must envision using this strike to “smash” the armour of your opponent
targeting either exposed areas (not armoured) or target arming points to compromise the
armour. Variations of this form include right-handed delivery only (dritto tondo),
delivery using the left hand (roversi tondo).

High Guard
As with the other alternative starting guard sections, it is important for the
student to transition through the high guard position which offers the best
position for initiating a strike leveraging gravity to enhance the power
behind the strike. Transitioning through the high guard is an effective
distraction to the opponent, and which should position yourself into a
advantageous position to deliver the horizontal strike.

Low Guard
Delivering the horizontal strike from this position will transition through a
high guard position and project incorrect information to the opponent, into
believing a downward vertical strike is eminent. An important skill is to
"project" to the opponent the intention to deliver perhaps a downward
vertical strike ("feint") and then deliver the horizontal strike.

Hanging Guard
As described previously, it is imperative that while cocking the sword to
deliver a horizontal cut, that the sword remain centred on the opponent to
maintain proper range and prevent the opponent from moving in to deliver
a counter. Imaging the sword in a cylinder such that as you rotate your
grip and hilt to position your arms for the horizontal strike, the point
remain relatively oriented towards the opponent.

Tail Guard
Again, a most deceitful and treacherous guard to begin with when
considering deploying a horizontal strike. Two manners of deployment: a)
raise your grip upward and behind your shoulder transitioning through a
guard of the woman, and finally pass through the high guard, drop the
point behind the back and swing out to deliver the horizontal strike; b) step
forward while swinging forward and from the side and raise to the high
guard and deliver the horizontal strike.

3.4.4: Oblique Upward Strike
Italian:
Fiore de’ Liberi: ridoppio (angled cut from below)
German:
Hans Talhoffer: unterhau/unterhieb (cut from below)
(Note: The target for this strike is the inner thigh, knee or the outer part of the lower leg.
The intent is to momentarily debilitate your opponent so that you can come in for the kill
before the opponent is able to recover.)
1. from the middle guard stance as illustrated below, raise the sword overhead to
assume the high guard stance
2. while you are doing this, begin to move your right leg forward to prepare to “plant’ it
forward
3. when the high guard has been achieved, feint a downward vertical strike and then
immediately drop the point dramatically behind you down the right side of your back
4. begin to arc upwards for a strike of about 45 degrees from the vertical towards the
lower left leg/inner thigh/knee of the opponent

Figure 22 the oblique upward strike
Note: The figure above illustrates the movements involved in the ridoppio strike. This
strike must be executed with swiftness to take advantage of a lower strike. When this
strike is deployed, one has to be careful with not exposing the head to a strike in
response.
Variations of this form include roverso ridoppio to strike from the left side to the right
and dritto ridoppio which is the strike from the right to the left. A brief explanation of
each follows.

Variations of the Oblique Upward Strike
roverso ridoppio (delivered from the left side to the right)
1. from middle guard stance with right leg forward, raise the sword overhead to
temporarily assume the high guard stance, and begin to step forward with the left
foot
2. when you have achieved the highest “potential” of the sword position, when the high
guard has been achieved, feint a downward vertical strike and then immediately drop
the point dramatically behind you down the left side of your back
3. begin to arc upwards for a strike of about 45 degrees from the vertical towards the
lower right leg/inner thigh/knee of the opponent
4. remember to choke the grip by sliding your left hand forward on the grip to come in
contact with the right hand to reduce the cross-wrists problem when deploying the
strike
(Note: This form is similar to the dritto ridoppio, except, that it is delivered from the
right.

Alternative starting guards for the oblique upward strike
Given the previous descriptions of alternative starting guard stances, why stop? An
oblique upward strike is deployed in two manners: a) with the true edge, b) with the false
edge. The edge used to deploy the strike is dependent upon the starting stance and
orientation of the blade. Other parameters include the height of the target that is going to
receive an oblique upward strike (i.e. a raise elbow or chin? or knee or crotch?). Also, in
general, delivering an upward strike with the false edge is typically a weaker of the
upward strikes.

High Guard
Delivering an oblique upward strike from this high guard stance projects
to the opponent, alternate objectives, i.e. will the strike come from
overhead or from the side? Assuming the high guard stance to deliver an
oblique upward strike is best considered for those upward strikes that are
targeting upper targets, such as the chin, or extended elbow. However, it is
not impossible to deliver an oblique upward strike that targets the lower
extremities of the body. In order to deliver an oblique upward strike,
essentially, the sword point is dropped behind you, and your grip passes
very closely to your forehead as you bring the sword about and upwards.
Low Guard
Once the low guard stance be acquired, and the target is the lower leg or
inner thigh area of the opponent, there are two delivery movements that
can be considered: a) simply raise the blade with force striking the target
with the false edge of the blade, b) dropping the point and passing it by
either on the right or left, hilt passing by the head and transitioning
through the guard of the woman and then delivering the oblique upward
strike.
Hanging Guard
As mentioned previously, when delivering the oblique upward strike from
the hanging guard position is to maintain the point of the blade centred
on the opponent while transitioning from the hanging guard to delivering
an oblique upwards strike. This will ensure that while you are "cocking"
yourself to deliver the strike, the opponent is kept at "bay" and therefore
reducing the opportunity to receive a strike.
Tail Guard
This guard position is most effective starting stance with when delivering
the angled cut from below when the strike is on the same side as the tail
guard. There are two delivery approaches: a) swing the sword forward and
strike with the false edge, b) transition through a high guard position again
to deliver this strike from the opposite side (from the left side) of the tail
guard (right side) which will "feint" your opponent into believing you will
deliver a downward strike, and continue with the cocking by delivering an
angled cut from below.

3.4.5: Upward Vertical Strike
Italian:
Vadi: montante (cut from below)
(Note: The target for this strike is the inner thigh, lower knee, elbow, chin, any
unprotected body target that is protruding and that is undefended.)
1. from the middle guard stance as illustrated below, raise the sword overhead to
assume the high guard stance
2. while you are doing this, begin to move your right leg forward to prepare to
“plant’ it forward
3. when the high guard has been achieved, feint a downward centre strike and then
immediately drop the point dramatically behind you down the right side of your
back
4. begin to arc upwards for a vertical strike towards the inner thigh of the opponent

Figure 23 the upward vertical strike
Note: The upward strike is deployed similarily to the ridoppio. The vertical strike can be
deployed from either the right side or the left side, in combination with proper footwork.

4.0 Solo Training Exercises
4.1 Sword control - “the pipe”
Pells have been used in training for literally hundreds of years as a tool to enhance the
strength and precision of the warrior. The opportunity with this training at this early
stage of development allows the student to "feel" the real "thing". Under close and strict
supervision, a student is able to strike the vertical pell and develop rudamentary skill in
an offensive strike with a true weapon. To enhance the training of pell usage, it is
advisable that marks be drawn on the vertical pell as a target for the strike. This
introduces a degree of difficulty for the student to address.
(Note: This exercise enhances your control of the sword. The objective is to deliver a
horizontal strike with full speed and power, and pull the strike just short of the hanging
pipe. This must be a repeatable execution.)
1. from the middle guard stance, deliver a horizontal strike as you would normally do
and target the handing pipe
2. you must deliver the horizontal strike with full speed and power
3. just short of striking the hanging pipe, pull the strike immediately
4. variations can be introduced including the sgualembrato and fendente (a horizontal
pipe must be in place to allow for practicing stopping the fendente)

Figure 24 sword control - horizontal strike and the "pipe"
Note: It is not known if this exercise was part of the medieval training repertoire, however, the
Academy is continuously researching both exercise forms and sword forms and introduces these
forms into this document. It was determined that this particular exercise form, promoted the
necessary qualities that makes one efficient and effective with the use of the sword. This exercise
is critical in achieving total sword control. This will be a requirement in order to participate in
future tournaments. Occasionally, if students are available, a partner can grasp the sword with
one hand, extend his/her arm outwards, and use the sword as the “pipe” for practice.

4.2 Cutting exercise with sharps and pell
(Note: The purpose of this training is to introduce the student to experiencing the cutting
action of a steel sword with the intent to elevate the appreciation of the sword as a deadly
weapon. This training will use cutting targets, such as a pell, and will be conducted
under close supervision of the instructor.)
1. starting from the middle guard position and armed with an edged steel sword, deliver
a downward strike to the horizontal pell
2. ensure that proper footwork and sword form are employed

Figure 25 cuting exercise with sharps and pell
The design of the pell may vary. The illustration above depicts a pell made of sonotubes, tough cardboard cylinders used in forming cement. The components are
replaceable as the tubes get significantly damaged during training. The horizontal pell
can simply be supported by rope at each end or stretched across carpenter horses or
similar supporting structured. It is critical that the pell is secure to the floor in order to
reduce accidents.

4.4 The “Moulinet”
The following text is an excerpt from “Old Sword-play” written by Capt. Alfred Hutton,
1892. The text is un-altered to preserve the “spirit” of his instruction.
“The six moulinets are absolutely necessary for the acquirement of dexterity in
wielding the two-hander; and in practicing them great care must be taken to keep the
hands well advanced, in order to avoid the accident of entangling the arms with the long
quillons of the sword. They are as follows:-Moulinet 1.
Motion 1.

Extend the arms with the sword pointing to the front a little above the
diagonal line 1 on the target, the right hand holding it close to the quillons
and the left hand close to the pummel.

Motion 2.

Bring the sword down, true edge leading, with a circular sweep from right
to left along the line, causing it to pass close to the left side, and
completing the circle bring it again to the front.

This moulinet, as likewise all the others, must be performed at first quite slowly in order
to ensure precision of movement; and afterwards the speed must be increased, and the
circle repeated continuously ten or twelve times. (this paragraph from “Cold Steel”,
A.Hutton)

Moulinet 2.
Motion 1.

Extend the arms as before, the point of the sword being just above
diagonal line 2.

Motion 2.

Describe a similar circle, the point traversing the diagonal line from left
to right, and passing close to the right side.

Moulinet 3.
Motion 1.

Extend the arms and sword with the point directed just below line 3.

Motion 2.

Make the cut diagonally upwards, and, after the sword has passed through
the target, complete the circle close to the right side.
Moulinet 4.

This must be performed as the last, save that the sword describes its circle close to the
left side and passes diagonally upwards from left to right.
Moulinet 5.
Motion 1.

Extend the arms and sword with the point just outside line 5.

Motion 2.

Describe the circle horizontally, the sword traversing the line from right
to left, and in the rearward half of the circle just clearing the top of the
head.
Moulinet 6.

This must be executed similarly to the last, the sword describing the circle from left to
right.”
The moulinet is intended to be practiced on one's own without a partner. This drill will
enhance one's strength and flexibility in the wrist and arms. This training drill has been
recommended in one form or another by swordsmasters of the past such as Giacommo di
Grassi (1570). The drill is comprised of six cuts, beginning with position #1 in the upper
right point. The pattern in the illustration is obtained from a reference to Roworth in
Hutton's book.

4.5 Spatial Awareness Training
A critical attribute, necessary for survival in any combat situation is the awareness of
things happening around you, without the need to physically look at it or direct your
attention to it. In a combat situation, your focus will be the enemy in front of you,
receiving your blows in your attempt at victory in this engagement. However,
surrounding you are other combatants, friend and foe, and one must be aware of what is
happening around you at all times to guarantee survival.
This exercise is designed to "re-awaken" certain sensory capabilities that have long been
nullified by our modern existence. The exercise is also structured to be humorous and
fun.
The Gauntlet
The first exercise utilizes a leather gauntlet (do not use a steel gauntlet, as it may damage
the floor!). Gather your students at one corner of the training room. Now toss the
gauntlet somewhere into the room so that it lands on the floor some distance away from
the students. One by one, the student will concentrate on the position of the gauntlet on
the floor, then, closing their eyes, carefully walk towards where they expect the gauntlet
to be. When the student believes he/she has reached the location of the gauntlet, crouch
down, with eyes closed, and slap the floor with the hand. Open the eyes to gauge the
accuracy of their ability to locate the gauntlet blind-folded17 .
The second exercise is similar to the first, however, the students, with eyes closed, is
required to spin, somersault, zig-zag, hop, skip, jump, and any other creative movement
as he/she moves in on the gauntlet. Still, the student has his/her eyes closed during this
entire exercise.
The end result of this exercise is that students come to realize that a) this isn't an easy
thing to accomplish; b) that this is something that is critical to survive in combat
situations. One of the purposes of such exercises is to enhance the student's appreciation
of relying on other senses or that "feeling" to aid in surviving an engagement. When one
wears a full helm, visibility can be reduced to approximately 15% of one vision,
therefore, other senses become important to gauge the range of the opponent and timing
for the attack or defense.

17

Of course, during this exercise, if the blind-folded student is walking towards the wall,
it is recommended that the instructor or students yell out instructions to prevent the
student from striking the wall!

5.0 Pairs-oriented Training – Folgen (drills)
Introduction
The purpose of the folgen is to introduce the student to a structured process of striking an
opponent with the sword to which the opponent will reciprocate with an appropriate
defensive action (parry). Each student will take turns in progressing through an
offensive and defensive drill. The drills are not meant to be the end point of fighting
technique. Rather they build muscle memory and teach students the basics so that later,
more advanced techniques can be taught.
Parrying is a critical element of good swordsmanship. Effective parrying may provide
the swordsman with ample opportunities to parry and counter often times at the same
time. Through the folgen, the student will learn the importance of a good parry, and the
importance of evading and good footwork. A key element of this training is to ensure the
student does not remain linear during defense ("deer in the headlights') and offensive
maneuvers. The best defense is to be where the sword is not, and that typically means to
move out of the way.
Another point that the student must understand is that parrying is done most often with
edge on flat. There has been no shortage of debate in the historical fencing community as
to whether the parrys should be deployed edge-on-edge or flat-on-edge or a variation. It
is thought that edge-on-edge parrys may have originated during the 17-19th centuries with
military sabres and small-sword duellists. The main physics behind flat-to-edge parry is
that it enables the wielder to deflect or redirect the oncoming strike quite effectively. If
the parry is edge-on-edge, there is a moment of binding occurring, resulting in the energy
of the weapons to suddenly dissipate. The objective of any swordsman is to achieve a
parry that will set him/her up to immediately reciprocate with a killing strike. Ultimately,
the student will learn the techniques that involve single-time parry-and-attack, leaving the
opponent very little time to react to the reciprocating strike.
The last point of these exercises is to ensure the student appreciates the importance of
good footwork. Gathered, passing and traverse steps will be employed during the drills.
The student will also learn that with good footwork, the ability to move offline (evading)
should ultimately become internalized providing the opportunity to reciprocate with a
deadly strike.
The ultimate objective of the drills is to achieve full free-form fechten. The drills in later
levels of competency can include practice with steel swords, however, in this level of
training, the students are limited to wooden wasters only.

The circle as illustrated demonstrates the angles of the
strikes and their relative targets. In later training, the
student must be aware that the entire circle and their
angles can be reduced in size and focused on a particular
body part, for example, the circle can be reduced to focus
on the chin. Therefore, all strike angles can be applied to
the chin.
For this level of training, the drills do not include thrusts.
This form of strike will be introduced in the next level.

5.1: Phase 1 (single strike è single ward – with reset)
This drill is performed such that the student, who is on the offensive, will complete an
entire circuit (starting from point 1 è concluding with point 8). The circuit or circle is
considered "single-dimensional", that being the strike is delivered, followed by an
appropriate parry only and no other techniques, strikes or parries are to be deployed.
The "reset" comes into play at the conclusion of each strike, placing both partners into a
middle guard stance. This is an effective mechanism to keep the speed down to a safe
and practical level.
When the student on the offensive (initially the "a" illustration - agent) reaches point 8
(the agent's completion of the circuit), they exchange their offensive with defensive
orientation, and the defensive student (initially the "b" illustration - patient agent) now
becomes the offensive.

The illustration above depicts the patient agent deploying the guard of the window left to
parry against the oblique downward strike (sgualembrato). The defensive maneuver is
similar to the previous drill involving the downward vertical strike except for the
direction of the traverse. When the agent strikes from his right, the patient agent moves
in on the agent's left. The key element in this drill is to evade the attack if possible and
move in towards the agent. Moving in onto the right provides the opportunity to deliver
at least three offensive types of defense: a) a strike such as a horizontal strike, b) halfsword for a thrust (not included in this level of training, c) close-quarters fight, i.e.
grappling.

Should the patient agent's feet be reversed (i.e. left foot forward), the patient agent would
still traverse to the right, but move the trailing right foot, leaving the left foot grounded.
This step is more of a passing traverse step. The main idea behind this form of guard is
to position the patient agent close to the agent, resulting in a good position to deploy a

Similar to the previous oblique strike, the agent targets the patient agent's right collar
bone (delivering the strike from the agent's left). The patient agent deploys a guard of the
window, positioning the hilt on the left side of the patient agent's head (placing the hands
furthest away from the oncoming strike). At the same moment, the patient agent takes a
passing traverse step, by moving the trailing right leg forward and to the left. The agent's
strike is re-directed away from the patient agent positioning the patient agent will be in a
good position for a reposte.

Alternative Starting Guards
In order for the student to practice the delivery of strikes from various guard positions, it
is critical that this phase of training drills be practiced with the alternative guard
positions. The student must develop a comfort with delivering strikes from any position
and must achieve the point in which this becomes natural without thinking about starting
from a different guard position. This movement is effective in confusing the opponent
which provides the opportunity to take advantage and control of the opponent. The
movement must be made crisply and quickly.
The following section describes an example pair of students delivering a strike from a tail
guard position. The first is a downward vertical strike from a tail guard, and the second
illustration depicts an angled cut from below from a tail guard.

In all of the other guard positions, the delivery of a strike in most cases will pass through
a high guard position. The purpose of this is to confuse the opponent into thinking that
some other strike will be delivered.

is important that regardless of the strike, especially for strikes delivered on the opposite
side of the tail guard, you will pass through the high guard. This includes a delivery of an
angled cut from below on the left side.

Figure 28 Tail Guard ==> Angled Cut from Below
The illustration above depicts the movements required to deliver an angled cut from
below from the opposite side to the guard of the tail.

5.2: Phase 2 (double cut è double guard – with reset)
Phase 2 introduces the student to delivering multiple offensive strikes while the partner
will invoke the appropriate multiple guard defenses. The student will start
with a vertical downward strike, followed an oblique downward strike
(squalembrato) followed by a reset. The student then exchanges the
offensive with the defensive and repeats the same strikes and defenses.
The idea is that the pairs will practice delivering strikes from all possible angles and the
defensive positions will defend against all variations of strikes.

The student returns to the middle guard position, and delivers the downward vertical
strike which is then followed by a horizontal strike. This is continuing the
training of being able to deliver offensive strikes from variable starting
positions, as well as from a defensive perspective, being able to defend
against variations of offensive forms.

Next Anchor Point
The students return to the middle guard position, and will now anchor
the strike at position #2, the oblique downward strike, followed by the
second strike in this drill. The rotation of the second strike to all of the
body points continues and completes with a downward vertical strike
(fendente). The anchor strike then moves again to a position of striking position #3, a
horizontal strike, while the second strike completes the circuit of all body points to the
last strike being the oblique downward strike on #2.

Appendix A - Training Opening and Closure
Formal Training Opening
In order to instill into the student, the respect of the sword, and the culture surrounding
training, every training session begins with the sword opening ritual and concludes with a
sword closure ritual. The opening is AEMMA's own design and not sourced from any
historical manuscript. Following the sword opening ritual, the training session begins
with a series of warmup exercises, followed by regular training.
blade

hilt

Figure 29 the formal training opening ritual
The figure above illustrates the opening forms. The ending of the opening is an offensive
position, namely, the middle guard or posta breve, in other words, you are now “armed”
and ready for combat. This opening form will place you into the combat mind set.
1. standing with feet together, sword in the scabbard position
2. grasp the grip with your right hand, and extend your sword arm straight out in front of
your chest, with the blade point forward and nearly parallel to the floor, count to
5,000 in 1,000’s (in silence), other arm straight down your side, slightly to the rear
3. bring the sword vertically again, hilt approximately mid-chest, count to 5,000 (in
silence), other arm still straight down your side, slightly to the rear
4. slowly rotate the sword such that the point arcs towards the right and continues in that
direction in a full arc until it is pointing towards the floor, at approximately 45
degrees off the floor, count to 5,000 in 1,000 increments (in silence), other arm still
straight down your side, slightly to the rear
5. from that sword position, with a “snap”, take the sword back to a vertical position,
tilted forward to about neck height of your imaginary opponent, grasp the hilt with
both hands, arms extended outward and downward, feet shoulder width apart and
knees slightly bent (this is a classic “posta breve” stance for offensive maneuvers),
hold for a moment then relax

Appendix B - Suggested and Example Warm-ups Exercises
B.1 Initialization of the Practice
Part of any effort of an organization focused on the training of medieval martial arts is the
culture that develops within any academy or school. At AEMMA, we begin each training
session with the sword opening with everyone participating, regardless of rank or skill.
The conclusion of training is conducted with the sword closure ritual. More information
on these opening and closure can be found in Appendix A.
(Note: In order to establish a “connection” between the student with his/her sword, each
student is issued a sword that the student will use throughout the practices and the term.
Therefore, the student is responsible for the care and maintenance of the sword assigned.
Some materials and supplies are available at the Academy for sword maintenance but
students are encouraged to purchase their own materials.)
1. check the condition of the metal of the blade, if the blade has some oxidation (rust),
use steel wool/sand paper to remove the oxidation
2. if the blade has lost any sheen due to oils/finger prints left on the blade, use steel wool
to remove these stains (these will eventually cause the blade to rust)
3. wipe the blade vigorously with an oiled cloth
4. check the condition of the hilt, guard and pommel, and apply maintenance to these
components as well (rubbing an oiled cloth on the pommel and guard, repairing the
leather wrap of the grip)
5. the student will wipe the blade with the oiled cloth at the end of the practice before
storing the sword
B.2 Initial Positioning and Exercise Start
(Note: The placement of the sword at the feet of the student reflects the “readiness” of
the student to arm himself/herself in the event of a surprise attack. Historically, training
schools, while in session, were occasionally attacked by their enemies, and therefore, the
student must always be prepared for battle and remain close to the sword at all times
during practice)
1. the students, armed with his/her sword are positioned into a circle, spaced by at least
an arm with sword extended
2. the swords are drawn and placed at their feet, at approximately 10 o’clock, hilt
nearest the feet, blade point outwards
3. at the end of the opening, everyone leaves the circle, split into two lines, walking the
perimeter of this circle (no one crosses the circle) and everyone meets at the bottom
(where ever the bottom is defined in the class)
Note: The student must recognize that the training is a serious venture, and that
ultimately, training with weapons invites potential injury. Therefore, the student must
demonstrate maturity and discipline at all times during the training session.

B.3 Hand/wrist exercises
Exercise 1: Finger-hand flexibility - “finger whip”
1. grasp the thumb/finger with the opposing hand, and “whip” the finger, so that the
wave travels down to the elbow
2. repeat for each finger
3. repeat for each hand, 3 times per hand
4. once both hands are completed, shake the hands with arms bent at the elbows, and
hands out in front (shake vertically and horizontally)
Exercise 2: Hand-wrist flexibility - “wrist twist”
1. right arm bent at the elbow against the side, forearm straight up with hand fully
extended and rotated at the wrist so that the side of the fifth finger is vertical, and near
the face
2. grasp the base of the thumb with the other hand, and force wrist further rotation with
this hand while the forearm remains vertical
3. with the other hand, pull the forearm down forward until the forearm is parallel with
the floor (at this point, the forearm should be 90 degrees with respect to the upper
arm, palm facing to the right if the right hand is undergoing this exercise)
4. from the position in which the palm is facing right and away from you, rotate the
hand/wrist so the thumb is point downwards again, but the palm facing to the right,
and grasp the base of the fifth finger
5. pull the hand (bent at the wrist) up towards your chin, all the while forcing the
rotation of the hand in the direction of the face
6. once this is completed, with the arms bent at the elbow, forearms forward, shake the
hands in a circular motion, clockwise up to 6 times, then counter-clockwise for the
same number
7. repeat for the other arm/hand combination, 3 times per hand
8. repeat hand/wrist shakedown again after step #7
Exercise 3: Hand strength enhancement - “5-finger spread”
(Note: This exercise and the following hand-oriented exercise focuses on the
development and enhancement of grip strength, critical in improved sword control and
execution of the forms)
1. position your forearms upwards, bent at the elbow, lower arm straight out from the
shoulder
2. hyper-extend your fingers and thumb and then close your hand quickly
3. repeat the extension and closure for up to 50 times
Note: For this and the next hand exercises, position yourself into a “saddle-mount”
stance to combine the hand exercises with leg strengthening exercise. To achieve this
position, feet together, then rotating on your heel, toes right and left, rotate on the ball,
heels right and left, rotate on heel, toes forward. Then squat. See illustration below.

Exercise 4: Hand strength enhancement - “finger clap”
1. position your forearms upwards, bent
at the elbow, lower arm straight out
from the shoulder
2. straighten your fingers, have the fingers
together, thumb pressed against the side
of your index finder, all pointing
upwards
3. without doing anything with your
thumb, bending your fingers, fold
against the palm of your hand
4. re-extend the fingers as in step #2 and
repeat for up to 50 times
Side view

Figure 31: saddle-mount leg exercise
B.4 Head/neck exercises
Exercise 1: Head-neck flexibility - “neck stretch”
1. with your hands resting on your hips, position the head forward and count to 6,000 in
1,000 increments
2. position the head to the left, tilting the neck and count to 6,000 in 1,000 increments
3. position the head to the right, tilting the neck and count to 6,000 in 1,000 increments
4. position the head to the rear, tilting the neck and count to 6,000 in 1,000 increments
5. repeat 3 - 6 sets
Exercise 2: Neck strengthening - “neck isometric” - optional
(Note: This exercise is important in the strengthening of the neck muscles and tendons in
order to easily support the weight of a helmet. This exercise should be continued offpractice by the student to achieve the desired results)
1. position your head and neck into the “neutral” position (this is where the neck and
back are relatively straight, chin somewhat tucked in)
2. with your left hand, place the hand on the left side of your head and push hard with
your hand, and at the same time, resist the pressure with your neck muscles to
maintain a vertical head-neck position - count to 10,000 in 1,000 increments
3. relax, and then place your right hand on the right side of your head, and repeat as in
#2
4. relax, place both hands on your forehead and push hard - count to 10,000 in 1,000
increments
5. relax, clasp your hands behind your head at the base of your head, and pull forward,
your neck and head maintaining its vertical position - count to 10,000 in 1,000
increments
6. relax, repeat the above up to 3 times

B.5 Upper body exercises
Exercise 1: Upper torso flexibility - “torso twist”
(Note: Flexibility in the torso is critical in combat. Swinging the sword, and trying to
obtain the most advantageous offensive positions will often require super extensions of
the torso)
1. with your left hand in a fist, elbows bent, fist in front of your chest, forearms parallel
to the floor, grasp the fist with your right hand and rotate your torso to the extreme
left
2. use your right hand to force the rotation to its maximum
3. repeat from left to right, making a fist with your right hand, grasping it with your left
hand, and rotate your torso from left to right
4. use your left hand to force the rotation to its maximum
5. repeat 24 times per side

Figure 32 torso twist
Exercise 2: Shoulder flexibility - “windmill”
(Note: The purpose of this exercise is to promote the flexibility and strength in the
shoulder area. Full, unrestricted shoulder movement is necessary in the ability to execute
the various offensive and defensive movements with the sword)
1. extend your arms straight out each side of the body, and clench your hands into a fist
2. starting with small clockwise circular movements of your arms, continue the circular
motions gradually expanding the circular motions until the maximum circular
motions are attained
3. reverse the direction at the maximum circular motion, and repeat, all the while the
circular motions gradually become smaller
4. repeat #2 but start in the counter-clockwise direction, followed by #3
5. repeat this 6 - 8 times

Exercise 3: Shoulder/elbow flexibility - “tarzan”
(Note: This exercise continues with promoting flexibility and strength in the upper body.
These forms enhance the student’s ability to control the sword with ease and duration)
1. keeping your arms up and extended straight outwards from each side of the body,
clench your hands into a fist
2. bend at the elbows, bringing the fists close together in front of your chest
3. extend your arms again to the outstretched position
4. repeat this 12 times at a frequency of about 1 movement/second
5. repeat this again, 12 times at double the frequency
Exercise 4: Balance and strength - “partner push”
(Note: This exercise will promote the ability to handle a “load” on the arms and legs by
using opposing force from a partner. This exercise will enable one to maintain good
balance and posture during offensive and defensive movements in battle)
1. grasp your partner’s hands, bend your right knee, left leg extended relatively straight
backwards, back straight but angled slightly off vertical in the direction of your
partner (your partner is doing the same, but opposite limbs)
2. now push against your partner’s hands, with your legs and arms in the attempt to
knock your partner off balance (count to 6,000 in 1,000 increments)
3. your partner will now do the same to you
4. when switching, shift to the opposite legs
5. repeat 6 - 8 times

B.6 Lower body exercises
Exercise 1: Knee/hip flexibility
(Note: Much of successful swordsmanship is good footwork. This requires not only
strength in the legs, but a high degree of flexibility. This exercise is similar to what would
be considered a warm up for running/jogging)
1. bend your right leg at the knee, and extend your left leg outward
2. drop down on your bent leg, and force the extension of your left leg
3. raise yourself up and then bend your left leg at the knee, and repeat the above on your
opposite leg
4. do not use your hands for balance by resting it on the bent knee, the hands/arms must
hang freely down which forces you balance properly
5. repeat 6 times per leg

Figure 34 knee/hip flexibility exercise
It is encouraged to perform these or alternative warm-up exercises and that students
should stretch all muscles from the toes to the neck. As a precaution, students that are
about to begin their training, should consult with their family physician to ensure that
they have no physical issues which may result in injury should it not be checked.
The warm-ups frequently vary from practice to practice and therefore, these suggested
exercises, including those that follow this section may not necessarily be incorporated

B.7 Sword-assisted exercises
Exercise 1: Grip and gravity-assist wrist rotation
(Note: In order to promote a firm but flexible grip of the hilt, this exercise is designed to
increase the flexibility of the wrist, and place a load on the grip of the hand)
1. feet approximately shoulder width apart, with the right arm extended outwards from
the side, and bent upward and forward at the elbow at approx. 45 degrees to the floor,
hand grasping the hilt and sword starting position, pointing upwards at the same
angle, swing the sword downwards and continue until the blade is approximately
parallel to the floor and the sword pointing backwards
2. use the momentum obtained by the sword to facilitate the swinging motion, you will
trace the bottom “half” of a circle with the tip of the sword
3. return the sword, swinging it forward from this position, until it reaches the starting
position (45 degrees from the floor, pointing upwards and forward)
4. “toss” the sword from your right hand to your left hand, and repeat with your left
hand
5. repeat 12 - 16 times per side

Figure 35 sword-assisted wrist rotation
Note: This exercise can be executed with variations, for example, one can simply swing
the sword back and forth on the same hand and wrist for up to 6 times, and then transfer
the sword to the other hand and repeat. A variation is to swing it towards the rear, and
swing it forward and transfer immediately to the other hand and repeat. The quick
switching of the hand improves ones confidence in handling the sword.
These exercises begin with the extremity of the arm, focusing on the grip and wrist. The
following move “up” the arm to focus on the lower arm, elbow and shoulder.

Exercise 2: Grip and anti-gravity wrist rotation
(Note: continuing with the focus on grip and wrist strength and flexibility, this exercise is
similar to the previous one, except that the upper half of the circle is traced with the tip of
the sword.)
1. feet approximately shoulder width apart, with the right arm extended straight
outwards from the side, hand gripping the hilt and sword starting in a vertical
position, pointing upwards with the edge pointing forward, begin tracing the circle
forward until the sword is pointing directly forward, parallel to the floor
2. from this position, begin tracing a complete arc of the upper half of the circle towards
the rear until the sword is parallel to the floor, pointing directly backwards
3. repeat 12 - 16 times per side
4. “toss” the sword from your right to your left hand and repeat

Note: The focus of this exercise is to increase the “stamina” of the arms by keeping the
arms extended outwards and elevated during the entire exercise on that arm. It is up to
the instructor to prolong this exercise should the students appear capable of performing
this with ease.
One of the purposes of “tossing” the sword from one hand to the other when switching
sides, is to raise the level of comfort with sword handling. The switching from one hand
to the other should be smooth and crisp.

Exercise 3: Forearm & elbow focus
(Note: Now shifting the focus to the forearm and elbow for strength and flexibility, this
exercise is best done with a steel sword.)
1. feet approximately shoulder width apart, with the right arm extended straight
outwards from the side, hand gripping the hilt and sword starting in a horizontal
position, pointing straight backwards
2. ensuring that the upper arm remains parallel to the floor, using only the elbow and
forearm, raise the sword (maintaining its parallel orientation) and “curl” the forearm
until it is perpendicular to the floor and the sword remains parallel to the floor
pointing directly
3. return the forearm to its starting position, horizontal to the floor
4. repeat 12 - 16 times per side
5. “toss” the sword from your right to your left hand and repeat

Figure 37 Forearm & elbow focus
Note: When conducting this exercise, the sword will have a tendency to swing inwards
and it is important that the backward orientation and parallel orientation to the floor
remain constant throughout this training exercise.
Caution: when bringing the forearm to a vertical position, given the momentum of the
forearm in combination with a sword will tend to continue towards the side of your head.

Exercise 4: Shoulder and grip focus
(Note: Continuing with moving up the arm, this exercise will focus on shoulder strength
and flexibility development. When conducting this exercise, care must be taken not to
strike students next to you.)
1. feet approximately shoulder width apart, with the right arm extended straight
outwards from the side, hand gripping the hilt and sword starting in a horizontal
position, pointing straight forward
2. while maintaining your arms outstretched position, begin tracing circles with your
hand, while the sword remains parallel to the floor pointing forward and continue
with this for 8 revolutions
3. reverse the direction of the sword, so that it is now pointing directly backwards, and
trace 8 more circles, maintaining the parallel orientation of the sword with the floor
4. continuing with the arm outstretched, sword pointing backward, draw a vertical line
upward and downwards and repeat this 8 times

Figure 38 Shoulder & grip focus

5. continuing with the arm outstretched, trace a line parallel to the floor, sword still
pointing backwards, arm parallel to the floor, trace it forward until the arm is
extending straight outwards forward, and then trace the line all the way to the rear and
repeat 8 times
6. repeat steps #4 and #5 with the sword pointing forward
7. “toss” the sword from your right to your left hand and repeat
8. repeat 2 - 8 times per side

Exercise 5: Shoulder stamina
(Note: This exercise focuses entirely on the strength and stamina of the shoulder muscles
as well as the upper arm and forearm muscles.)
1. feet approximately shoulder width apart, with the right arm extended straight
outwards from the side, hand gripping the hilt and sword starting in a horizontal
position, extending straight out the outstretched arm
2. while maintaining this position, begin counting to 10, increase count over time
3. while keeping the arm outstretched, reposition the extended arm so that it extends
directly forward from your chest
4. while maintaining the orientation of the sword, pointing directly forward, count to 50
5. while maintaining the arm extension, raise the arm straight upwards, with the sword
positioned vertically with the point pointing towards the ceiling, count to 50

Exercise 6: Grip and shoulder exercise - “figure “8”
(Note: This exercise must be conducted with caution. The sword is swung over-head and
possibility of injury to the student or others nearby exist. This exercise is designed to
enhance the control of the sword, strengthen the grip, enhance the flexibility of the wrist
and shoulders)
1. feet approximately shoulder width apart, with the right arm extended outwards from
the side, and bent upward and forward at the elbow at approx. 45 degrees to the floor,
hand grasping the hilt and sword starting position, pointing upwards at the same
angle, swing the sword forward and continue the same direction overhead from the
rear (keep the “plane” of the circle as vertical as possible, close to the body)
2. when the sword has reached its starting position, transfer the sword to the other hand
smoothly and repeat on the other side of the body (from the front, it will look like you
are carving out a squat infinity sign “∞” or a flattened figure “8” on its side
3. the circular movements and transfer of the sword from hand to hand must be
conducted in a smooth and fluid manner
4. repeat 12 times per side

Exercise 7: Upper torso flexibility - “sword-assisted twist”
(Note: When grasping the blade with your hand, your thumb will be placed on one side of
the blade, and fingers, bent on the other side of the blade. The objective of this hold, is
that one should be able to slide another sword down the blade which is grasped by the
hand, without striking the hand. This is a critical maneuver in future defensive
movements. This manner of grasping the blade must become internalized and natural)
1. from the posta breve serpentina, (guard of the short serpent) and with your right hand
on the hilt, grasp the blade with your left hand18 and rotate your torso to the right
2. while you are rotating to the right, drop your hilt end of the sword downwards and
raise the point of the blade upwards, so that the final position of the sword is reached
in that the hilt is pointing downward, and the point pointing upward
3. begin to rotate the torso in the opposite direction, and at the same time, rotate the
sword so that it will point is downward at the end of the rotation on the left side
4. repeat 24 times per side

Figure 41 sword-assisted torso twist
Note: The figure above illustrates the three positions of this exercise. The torso rotates
from left to right and the momentum of the sword is used to force hyper-extension of the
back during the rotation. This forms the basic movement in the future half-sword
techniques.

Exercise 8: Sword control - “the baton” (optional)
(Note: This exercise will enhance your control and movement of a rapidly moving sword.
The objective is to repeatedly swing the sword in great arcs over and over again, and to
preserve the form and precision of the execution of this exercise form.)
1. beginning with the posta di coda lunga e distesa (guard of the long and stretched out
tail) from a relatively “relaxed” position, with sword in the “scabbard” on your left
side, grasp the grip with your right hand with the palm facing upward and towards the
left
2. you must deliver the horizontal strike with all of the power of completing the delivery
3. just short of striking the hanging pipe, stop the blade immediately
4. repeat 12 - 24 times
5. variations can be introduced including the sgualembrato and fendente (a horizontal
pipe must be in place to allow for practicing stopping the fendente)

Figure 42 sword control - the “baton"
Note: It is not known if this exercise was part of the medieval training repertoire,
however, the Academy is continuously researching both exercise forms and sword forms
and introducing these forms into this document. It was determined that this particular
exercise form, promoted the necessary qualities that makes one efficient and effective
with the use of the sword.

Appendix C - Augmenting Training
Training in European medieval martial arts consists of far
more than training with a sword. It is essential that one include
training that enhances ones physical stamina, strength and
endurance. The medieval martial arts training is a large
component of overall training, however, it is important to
include other physical training to facilitate and enhance the
ability to withstand competition and tournament situations. It
is clear that there are three main weapons in any arsenal: a)
endurance, b) skill and c) cunning. Augmentation of this
martial arts training will address the first of the arsenal. It is
important enough that Giacomo DiGrassi stated :
“Therefore let every man that is desirous to practice this Art,
endeavor himself to get strength and agility of body, assuring himself, that judgment
without this activity and force, avails little or nothing.”
There are two fundamentally different types of endurance: muscular and cardiovascular.
Muscular endurance is the ability of muscle to engage a large number fibres during sword
training such that you can do numerous drills and folgen without taking long breaks for
recovery. For example, while doing a series of phase 3 drills, you fatigue your arms and
legs that if you want to get through an entire repeating set you need to be able to bring
many additional fibres into play. Aerobic endurance is the ability of the heart, lungs and
circulatory system to deliver oxygen to the muscles to fuel further drills engagement.
Aeorbic Endurance
In order to enhance one’s cardiovascular fitness, a regimen of running programs is
required. This does not mean that one needs to be able to run marathons. The running is
structured to focus on what is needed to endure long periods of time with full armour, in
tournament competition or demonstration events. The thing to remember when training
is intensity. The general rule of thumb is the harder you train/work, the more results you
will see. The training program suggested below may not work for everyone and may
need to be altered to suit your particular needs.
The following is a suggested running program. (Note: before engaging in any strenuous
physical exercise, see a doctor if you have doubts on what your heart can take. A fullblown physical is wise before you launch into training.).
Phase 1:
Begin a running program (ensure that proper footwear is used). It does not matter
whether you run cross-country or on the street. You should target at least 2 miles (3.22
km), 3 – 4 times per week, and running at about 20 – 30 minutes. Make sure you start off
with a warm-up, that includes the usual stretching and flexing exercises before any

workout. Over time, once you feel that you can comfortably
cover the distance within that period of time, you will proceed
to phase 2.
Phase 2:
Apply weights straps to your ankles. These would weigh in at
approx. 1 – 1 ½ lbs (.45 kg - .68 kg). These weights are soft,
lead pellet filled bands that will attach to your ankles with a
velcro strap. Continue running the same distance as in phase
1, achieving a similar time/distance ratio. Occasionally, stop
for a moment during your run, and transfer the weighted straps
to your wrists, and continue with the run to its conclusion. Once you feel that you can
comfortably cover the distance within 20 – 30 minutes, you will proceed to phase 3.
Phase 3:
Increase the weight straps on your ankles to 3 lbs (1.36 kg) per ankle. Continue running
the same distance as in phase 1, achieving a similar time/distance ratio. Once you feel
that you can comfortably cover the distance within 20 – 30 minutes, you will proceed to
phase 4.
Phase 4:
Continuing with the weighted straps from phase 3, attach the weighted straps from phase
2 to your wrists. This will increase the overall load on the body to
endure for the distance covered. Continue with this weighted
condition until you feel comfortable covering the distance within 2030 mintues.
The above phases are a rough guide to endurance and cardiovascular
training. The duration of each phase is completed dependent upon the
individual undergoing the training. The objective of the weighted
belts, is to condition the body into supporting additional weight. In
full gear, including sword, the kit may weigh upwards of 60 lbs.
If you are experiencing some difficulties as a result of the training
above such as persistent or recurring pain, it is advisable that you visit
your doctor. A useful resource on the web is Dr. Pribut's Running
Injuries Page located at the URL: http://www.clark.net/pub/pribut/spsport.html It has
useful information on a running training program and advise on many issues faced by
runners.

Weight Training
If this is your first foray into weight training, you must set a clear goal in mind. Why
begin weight training? Health? (true, this will enhance your
health). To improve martial arts capabilities? (true, this will
enhance your abilities). This will help in determining your
training program. If your objective is body building, then you
should not read this manual any further…you are in the wrong
activity. However, if your focus is to enhance your strength,
flexibility and endurance for medieval martial arts training, read
on.
The weight training program described below, is known as the
“vegetable soup” program. It is a general weight training
program that addresses most areas of the body. Your genetic
disposition will also have a lot to do with how you will respond
to training. For some, it may take many weeks or months before
anything noticeable is achieved, however, some will take only a
few weeks. AEMMA's preference to weight training is free weights (barbells, dumbbells,
etc.) rather than machines. Free weights place greater demand on your body, and yet
allow your joints and limbs to move in their natural planes, often not possible with the
exercise machines available. It is important that wielding a sword, requires great amount
of flexibility and movement along various planes. However, if free weights are not
available, machines are obviously the way to go.
When you are about to embark on weight training, appropriate gear is important. These
include footwear (flat soled training shoes), weight-lifting gloves, weight belt to help
support the muscles of the lower back when lifting heavy weights, head straps which will
allow you to do progressive-resistance exercises for the neck (after all, you will be
wearing heavy helmets, coif and or aventail). Another point to consider, is that one is
never too old to begin training. See your doctor if you're unsure.
The general principle of weight training is if you can perform the specific exercise of 8
reps/set, 3 sets/workout and 3 workouts in a row, then you would increase the load by
about 10%. The training session is a personal thing, however, the template training
program below will provide an idea of what a training program should contain.
Determine what your maximum weight is before you start your training program. To
determine the weights to use per set, target 3 sets of 8 repetitions each. Initially, you may
appear to be progressing quickly, however, once the proper weight is achieved, you may
be able to do 8 on the first set, 6 on the second, and 4 on the third. This is where you
want to be. From here, you continue training until you can achieve 3 sets of 8, 3 training
sessions in a row. The sequence is not important, however, the following appears to work
for our program.
The program outlined below also assumes that you are familiar with weight training. If
you are about to begin a program of weight training and have not done this before, there
are excellent resources available in the library and online. It is recommended that you
begin by joining a local fitness club to receive instruction in person.
